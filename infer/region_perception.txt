### Region Perception Task Prompt

#### Task Objective:
This task aims to evaluate MLLMs' capability to understand and describe corner objects within specific bounding boxes, and to explain why these objects might affect self-driving behavior. The goal is to provide a detailed perception analysis for the objects highlighted in the provided bounding boxes.

#### Instructions for the Model:
You are an experienced driver tasked with analyzing objects within specific bounding boxes in a given traffic scene. The scene is captured from the perspective of the ego car. Focus your analysis on the objects inside the red rectangles.

#### Prompt:

**Context**:
- You will be given an image depicting a traffic scene from the perspective of the ego car.
- The objects you need to focus on are marked with red rectangles in the image.

**Guidelines**:
1. **Carefully analyze** the objects within the red rectangles.
2. **Describe** each object's appearance, position, and direction.
3. **Explain** why each object would affect the ego car's driving behavior.

**Example Question**:
Please describe the object inside the red rectangle in the image and explain why it affects ego car driving.

**Response Format**:
For each object within the red rectangle, describe its appearance, position, and direction, followed by an explanation of its impact on driving behavior.

**Example Response**:
1. **Object**:
   - **Description**: The object inside the red rectangle is a pedestrian. They are positioned at the edge of the crosswalk on the left side of the road, facing towards the ego car and preparing to cross.
   - **Impact**: The pedestrian poses a potential hazard as they are about to cross the road, requiring the ego car to yield and ensure their safety before proceeding.

2. **Object**:
   - **Description**: The object inside the red rectangle is a traffic cone. It is located in the middle of the right lane, standing upright and signaling a construction area.
   - **Impact**: The traffic cone indicates a need for the ego car to change lanes or slow down, avoiding the area marked by the cone to prevent collision.

3. **Object**:
   - **Description**: The object inside the red rectangle is a car. It is parked on the right side of the road, facing the same direction as the ego car.
   - **Impact**: The parked car might obstruct the ego carâ€™s view of pedestrians or other road users, necessitating caution as the ego car approaches this area.

**Notes**:
- Be precise and clear in your analysis and descriptions.
- Ensure that your descriptions and explanations are practical and applicable to real-world driving scenarios.
- Focus on providing a comprehensive and accurate assessment of the current driving environment.
