Additionally, several vehicles, including a darker colored SUV, are observed in the oncoming lane. While these vehicles pose less of a direct threat, they must be monitored for any sudden lane changes or erratic behavior that could affect driving conditions.\n\nNo vulnerable road users or traffic signs are present in the image.\n\nOverhead street lamps are lined up along the road, which, although not traffic lights, are essential for maintaining visibility during low-light conditions such as dusk or nighttime.\n\nTraffic cones are positioned around a small construction or maintenance site on the right side of the road. These cones serve as a warning for a potential hazard or a change in the traffic pattern, advising the ego car to stay alert and possibly reduce speed while navigating past this area.\n\nThere are no barriers or other objects reported in the image."
