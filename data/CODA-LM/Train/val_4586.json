        "description and explanation": "The scene contains a yellow crane truck with prominent high visibility markings and an upward-extended crane arm on the road's left side. This crane truck could potentially disrupt traffic due to its size and the extended crane arm, as it might occupy additional space or execute unexpected maneuvers, which would impact both the flow and safety of the surrounding traffic. Behind this crane truck, there appears to be a yellow service vehicle, likely another truck, which is only partially visible. This vehicle, given its larger service-type appearance, contributes to the road congestion and may restrict the maneuverability for the ego vehicle and other road users. Additionally, overhead, there are utility poles and tree branches, which pose a risk for falling debris due to the crane's operations. The presence of such overhead activities necessitates increased alertness for potential hazards that may arise suddenly. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers recorded in the image."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a yellow construction vehicle equipped with a crane arm, commonly used for lifting heavy materials at construction sites. Its presence on the road indicates ongoing or nearby construction work. For the ego car, this may necessitate reduced speed and heightened awareness for potential obstacles or road changes such as lane closures or detours. Additionally, the size and operation zone of the vehicle could influence the available roadway space, thereby requiring cautious and attentive driving from the ego car to safely navigate the area.",
