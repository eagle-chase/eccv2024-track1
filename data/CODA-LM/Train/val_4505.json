This parked vehicle occupies part of the road, potentially narrowing the drivable area for the ego car.\n   - Additionally, a white car is positioned slightly ahead of the ego car on the same side of the road, indicating that it is either in motion or preparing to move. This vehicle may influence the speed and movement of the ego car as it is directly in its line of travel.\n\n2. **Traffic Signs**:\n   - A 'No Parking' sign is present on the right side of the road, indicating parking restrictions. This sign informs drivers, including the ego car, that parking is not allowed in this area, guiding legal parking behavior."

The vehicle is oriented diagonally to the camera's point of view, which suggests it may be in the process of parking or leaving a parking space. The illuminated brake lights are a crucial visual cue for the ego car; they indicate that the vehicle is likely to be stationary or moving slowly, which necessitates increased caution and potentially a reduction in speed from the ego car to prevent any collision.",
