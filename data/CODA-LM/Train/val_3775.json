However, there is a vulnerable road user, a small dog, that can be seen on the road to the left side ahead. The presence of the dog could lead to potential hazards as it may behave unpredictably. Consequently, the autonomous vehicle should be prepared to slow down or even stop to ensure safety. Alongside this, there is a set of traffic lights in view that is currently showing a green light. While this green light gives the ego vehicle the right to proceed, caution is still advised due to the possibility of the dog moving into the path of the vehicle."
