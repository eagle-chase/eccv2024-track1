Also on the left, but situated on the median strip, is a yellow construction vehicle facing the opposite direction. This vehicle may signify upcoming road work, which could impact the traffic flow and available lane space. In the distance on the right, a green bus facing the same direction as the ego car suggests there may be a bus stop ahead; this could cause the ego car to slow down or stop for passengers.\n\nAdditionally, an orange construction vehicle is located on the median strip, indicating ongoing road work and the potential for lane narrowing or obstructions near the traffic lane. Furthermore, a white bus is parked on the right side of the road next to the green bus, both facing the ego vehicle. While the parked white bus doesn't pose an immediate effect on the ego car's motion, it indicates possible pedestrian activity in the vicinity. Lastly, a median strip barrier is present between opposing traffic lanes, which contains construction vehicles and directs the traffic, shaping the path available to the ego car. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the image."

            "description and explanation": "A construction vehicle, specifically an excavator, is shown. This type of vehicle is often used in construction projects for tasks such as digging, material handling, and demolition. In a driving scenario, the presence of a construction vehicle suggests that there might be ongoing construction work nearby, which can influence driving behavior. Drivers should be cautious, reduce speed, and be prepared for potential road blockages or diversions caused by construction activities. Additionally, the operation of such heavy machinery close to the roadway can lead to sudden movements into the driving lanes, necessitating alertness and readiness to stop or maneuver safely.",
