Additionally, there are various cars that are both moving and parked on the road, adding to traffic density and requiring careful navigation and speed control from the ego car.\n\nThere is also a traffic sign on the right side of the road near the parked vehicles. While the specific message of the sign is unclear, its placement suggests it might convey information about construction, or provide directions or warnings, which would influence driving decisions.\n\nFurthermore, orange traffic cones have been placed in the middle of the road to create a makeshift path for vehicles. These cones are likely in place to guide traffic around construction or other obstacles, signaling that drivers should pay attention and potentially change lanes.\n\nFinally, there are barriers set up, encircling an excavation or construction area on the side of the road, indicating the presence of roadworks. These barriers may cause unexpected obstructions or reduce the number of available lanes, which would require drivers to be cautious."
