The size and position of the truck may obstruct the view ahead, necessitating a safe following distance and readiness for sudden stops. Alongside, several motorcycles and scooters are moving parallel to the ego car on the right side of the road. These smaller and more agile vehicles pose a risk due to their potentially unpredictable movements. Additionally, a blue car is farther ahead in the right lane, near the motorcycles, which may lead to lane changes or speed adjustments that could affect the ego car's driving decisions.\n\nOn the same side of the road, multiple cyclists and pedestrians are present, with some crossing the street. Their proximity to the driving lane increases the need for the ego car to drive cautiously and be prepared to stop if necessary.\n\nA fence is also visible on the right, delineating the sidewalk from the road. This barrier helps to ensure that pedestrians and cyclists are less likely to enter the roadway unexpectedly, offering a slight reduction in risk for the ego car.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the scene that impact the driving behavior of the ego car."
