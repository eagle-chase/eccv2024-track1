Additionally, a traffic light displaying a green signal is seen in the distance, allowing the ego car to proceed but with the awareness that the light may soon change. Other elements in the scene include reflective barriers situated around a guarded area on the right, instructing the ego vehicle to stay in its current lane and avoid entering the marked space. Furthermore, a yellow bike is noted on the far left side, secured to a bike rack, which, while not an immediate hindrance, signals a possible area where cyclists may emerge or set off, thereby necessitating watchfulness for potential cyclists moving into the car's path. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."
