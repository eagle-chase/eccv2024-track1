There are two notable vehicles: a black SUV parked on the right side of the road, partially obstructing the lane, which may limit the driving space for the ego car, requiring careful maneuvering or slowing down, and several cars parked slightly back from the main road on the right side in various colors (white, gray). While these parked cars do not immediately impact the ego car's path, attention is necessary in case one starts moving or a pedestrian emerges from between them.\n\nA single vulnerable road user is identified: a pedestrian, likely a maintenance or construction worker dressed in yellow, is walking near the black SUV on the right side. This pedestrian could unexpectedly step onto the driving lane, necessitating that the ego car be ready to stop or slow down suddenly.\n\nAdditionally, bright yellow traffic cones are placed around the black SUV, indicating a caution area or temporary no parking zone. The cones signify a need for heightened awareness and possibly signal a restricted or narrowed driving path, directly impacting driving decisions."

The cone is bright orange with a reflective band to enhance visibility. In this scenario, the presence of the traffic cone on the road indicates that there might be a hazard or construction nearby, signaling to the ego car to reduce speed and proceed with caution, possibly even to change lanes if safe and necessary to avoid the cone and any potential obstacle around it.",
