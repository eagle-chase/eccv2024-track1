This indicates that the vehicle is currently stopped due to traffic, requiring the ego car to maintain a safe distance and be prepared to stop.\n\nIn front of the white sedan, there is a cargo truck partially laden with debris and a potentially unstable load. This truck poses a hazard as its load could fall onto the road. The ego car should keep a safe distance and remain cautious of any falling objects.\n\nAdditionally, multiple vehicles are present in the adjacent lane and are stationary due to traffic. This situation may limit the ego car's maneuverability, and it should be mindful of these vehicles potentially merging into its lane.\n\nMoreover, a yellow traffic light is observed above the cargo truck. This indicates that the signal is about to change to red, and the ego car should prepare to stop if the light changes before it can safely pass through the intersection.\n\nFinally, the current state of the traffic light is yellow. The ego car should be prepared to stop as the light is likely to turn red soon."
