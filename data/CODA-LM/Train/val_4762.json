The vehicle is white and gray, featuring a bulky frame and a rotating drum on top. Due to its size and the relatively narrow lanes, increased caution is required; this may involve reducing speed or changing lanes to maintain safe driving distances.\n\nA green directional sign is visible on the right side of the road, just above the road divider. This sign provides directions or road information that may guide the ego car, especially if a route change is needed soon.\n\nAdditionally, there is a median strip or barrier lined with vegetation between the different directions of traffic. This structure serves to divide oncoming and ongoing traffic lanes, emphasizing the importance of staying within lane markings to prevent accidents."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, specifically a concrete mixer truck. It is equipped with a rotating drum that mixes concrete which can be discharged at a construction site. The presence of this type of vehicle on the road typically signals nearby construction activity, which may lead to delays or detours in the typical traffic pattern. It is important for the ego vehicle to maintain a safe following distance, given that these trucks can make sudden stops and their large size can obstruct the drivers view of the road ahead.",
