Although they are not on the road, their proximity to the edge of the roadway poses a potential risk factor, as there is a chance they could unpredictably step onto the street.\n\nFurther in the distance, a traffic light is visible, currently displaying a green signal. This permits the ego car to proceed; however, it also implies the need for vigilance for possible changes in the traffic light status, which would necessitate the ego car to slow down or stop."
