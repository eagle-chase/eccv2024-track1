This vehicle, while stationary, restricts the available lane width, necessitating careful navigation.\n   - A red van is parked on the opposite side of the road, facing the ego car. Similar to the blue car, this van limits lane space, posing potential difficulties if there are oncoming vehicles.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**: \n   - A man is standing at a bus stop, looking at his phone. His distraction could lead to him stepping unpredictably into the roadway, increasing the risk.\n   - Several people are seated at the same bus stop. They are in close proximity to the road and may stand up to board a bus or cross the street, posing a potential hazard.\n\n3. **Other Objects**: \n   - A billboard displaying information is located on the left side of the road. While it does not directly impede the ego car's path, it could act as a visual distraction, diverting the driver's attention from the road.\n\nThese insights collectively emphasize the need for vigilance and cautious driving to navigate the restricted lane spaces and mitigate potential risks posed by distracted pedestrians and visual distractions."
