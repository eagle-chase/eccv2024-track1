Firstly, there is a white van parked in the right lane directly in front of the ego car, with its rear doors open and a person interacting with the rear of the van. This vehicle is causing an obstruction in the right lane, reducing the available road width and potentially causing traffic to slow down or stop, particularly affecting the lane the ego car is in.\n\nAdditionally, a blue car is traveling in the left lane, moving ahead of the ego car. This car is part of the normal traffic flow and serves as an indicator of the flow and speed of the left lane, which could be an alternative route for the ego car to consider.\n\nRegarding vulnerable road users, there is an adult male standing next to the parked van, partially on the roadway and the curb, interacting with the van. The proximity of this pedestrian to the vehicle lane presents a risk as there is a possibility of sudden movement into the roadway, requiring the ego car to monitor the situation carefully.\n\nAnother partially visible adult appears to be walking near the curb behind the open door of the van. This pedestrian's movements should be watched closely by the ego car to avoid any potential collision, as they may step into the vehicle's path.\n\nA pedestrian crossing sign is also present next to the parked van, signaling a zone where high pedestrian activity is likely. This sign alerts the ego car to be prepared for and cautious of pedestrians who may be crossing or near the roadway.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image."
