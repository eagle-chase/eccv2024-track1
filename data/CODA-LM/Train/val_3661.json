This truck is large, with a rotating drum, and due to its size and slow-moving nature, it could reduce visibility ahead and may maneuver or stop unpredictably. This necessitates increased following distance and heightened attention from the ego vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, there is a light-colored sedan in the left adjacent lane, positioned ahead and slightly to the left of the ego vehicle. The ego vehicle must monitor this sedan as it may change lanes or adjust speed, requiring attention to potential merges or braking scenarios.\n\nFurthermore, a yield sign for pedestrians is visible on the right side of the road, illuminated by street lights. The ego vehicle should be prepared to yield to pedestrians who may be crossing from the right, especially under low visibility conditions."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, specifically a cement mixer. It is a large truck equipped with a rotating drum designed to mix concrete which is visibly mounted at the rear. Due to its nature and size, it requires ample space for operation and movement. In a driving scenario like this, the ego car should maintain an increased distance from the construction vehicle for safety. The presence of this vehicle also suggests possible nearby construction activity requiring heightened alertness for sudden stops or reduced speeds.",

Keep an eye on the sedan in the adjacent lane for any lane changes, especially since the driver's visibility may be compromised by the truck. Be prepared to yield to pedestrians near the pedestrian crossing sign. Given the lack of visibility ahead, reducing speed and heightening awareness is advised."
