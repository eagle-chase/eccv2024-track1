A prominent overhead green traffic sign indicates exits and directions, which is crucial for upcoming navigation decisions, especially concerning lane selection. Bright orange traffic cones are positioned along the left edge of the left lane, signaling a boundary or ongoing road work, guiding the ego car to maintain a safe distance and possibly indicating a lane closure or hazards. Additionally, metal guardrails are present along the right side and in the median of the highway, marking the edges of driving lanes and the separation of opposing traffic flows, essential for lane positioning and collision prevention."

These barriers can significantly affect driving behavior, as they dictate the limits of the travel lane and require the driver to maintain a safe distance to prevent collisions. They contribute to the overall safe organization of traffic flow by clearly defining and separating lanes of traffic. Safe driving next to barriers involves consistent observance of lane discipline and awareness of vehicle positioning.",
