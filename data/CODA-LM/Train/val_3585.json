It is bright orange with a reflective band to enhance visibility, especially in low light conditions such as nighttime as seen in the image. The presence of the traffic cone in this driving scenario suggests that there might be some sort of road work or hazard ahead. The ego car will need to navigate carefully around this cone, maintaining a safe distance, and possibly merging to an adjacent lane if the lane in which the cone is placed is partially or fully blocked.",
