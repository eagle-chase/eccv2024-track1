The presence of this vehicle is significant as it could affect the speed adjustments or lane choices for the ego vehicle due to its direct path and proximity.\n\nAdditionally, a cyclist is spotted near the curb on the right side of the road, seemingly preparing to ride. The cyclist's proximity to the traveling lane means the ego car must be vigilant for any potential sudden movements into the traffic lane, which could require evasive maneuvers or speed adjustments to maintain safety.\n\nFurthermore, there are traffic signs on the right side of the road, including a bus stop sign. The bus stop sign suggests that there may be buses slowing down or stopping unexpectedly, which could impact the traffic flow and necessitates heightened awareness from the ego car.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
