The presence of this parked car is a potential hazard as it could obstruct the view for the ego vehicle. Additionally, there's a risk that an individual may unexpectedly open a car door or step out into the road from between parked cars, which would require the ego car to be prepared to react to such situations.

The visibility of the car is relatively low due to nighttime conditions and wet road surfaces which can reflect light and obscure clear sight lines. The ego car must maintain a cautious approach, ensuring that it maintains a safe distance and keeps an eye on the parked car for any sudden movements such as doors opening or the car pulling out into the road. This requires the driver to reduce speed and be prepared to stop or maneuver if necessary.",
