        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are three vehicles in close proximity to the ego car. The first is a large concrete mixing truck right in front of the ego car, marked with the number '1 7036', suggesting it's part of a larger fleet. The truck's considerable size and its central position greatly limit the view and possible driving paths for the ego car, indicating the need for increased following distance and more cautious driving.\n\nTo the left of the ego car, there's a white sedan that is slightly ahead and only partially in view. This sedan is also an active factor in the traffic, adding to the considerations the ego car must make while navigating the environment.\n\nAdjacent to the concrete mixing truck in the left lane, a blue and white public bus is present. Due to its size and its operational characteristic of making frequent stops, the bus could potentially obstruct the lane and alter the flow of traffic, requiring further attention from the ego car.\n\nNo other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are described in the scene."

The bus being on the road implies that the ego car might need to be prepared for frequent stops or slow traffic movement ahead especially if the bus is engaged in picking up or dropping off passengers. Additionally, the presence of the bus might require the ego car to maintain a safer following distance and anticipate potential pedestrian movement near bus stops.",

The ego car should not attempt to overtake unless there is clear visibility and space to do so safely."
