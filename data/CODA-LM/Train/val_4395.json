The presence of the parked SUV is significant as it narrows the usable width of the road, which may affect the driving behavior of the ego car by limiting its maneuvering space. Additionally, there is a pedestrian with a blurred appearance walking along the edge of the road on the right, facing the ego car. The pedestrian's proximity to the roadway and their direction of movement pose potential safety concerns that need to be considered by the ego car, especially given the pedestrian's unclear visibility, which could be indicative of nighttime conditions. There are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving environment."
