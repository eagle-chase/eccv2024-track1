The first vehicle is a grey sedan that is partially blocking the road ahead and is facing the ego car. It has visible damage on its front left side, which suggests it may have been involved in an accident. This sedan poses a collision risk for the ego car, especially in conditions where visibility is compromised.\n\nThe second vehicle is a white sedan parked on the left side of the road. It is oriented perpendicular to the ego car and slightly extends into the road. This could potentially narrow the drivable path for the ego car, requiring careful maneuvering to avoid.\n\nAdditionally, there is a concrete barrier placed in front of the damaged grey sedan. It seems to be there to indicate ongoing road work or to serve as a temporary measure following an accident. The barrier is contributing to the blockage of the road and is directing the traffic flow. As a result, the ego car will need to navigate around it or consider turning back if the path ahead is completely blocked."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a car, specifically a white sedan. It appears to be parked on the side of the road. The presence of this parked vehicle in the driving scenario can require the ego car to adjust its path to ensure a safe distance is maintained while passing by. This reduces the risk of side collisions and promotes smooth traffic flow. The presence of a parked vehicle at night also necessitates careful driving due to potentially reduced visibility and the possibility of the car suddenly entering traffic.",
