Some of these spools are standing upright, and one is positioned horizontally. Despite their presence, they are situated at a safe distance from the active roadway and, therefore, do not represent a direct threat to the ego car's travel path. There are no vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers in the image that need to be taken into account."

            "description and explanation": "This object appears to be a large, metallic spool wheel used for the storage and transport of industrial cables or wires. Its characteristics including its structure of strong metallic beams shaped in circular form with cross-sectional beams signify its use in holding substantial lengths and weights of utility materials. The presence of this object adjacent to the driving path indirectly influences the driving situation by marking an industrial area or storage facility, which might mean that there could be heavy vehicles moving in or out of the area. Drivers should therefore remain vigilant for sudden entries or exits by such vehicles and possibly reduced speed limits or warnings specific to industrial zones.",

Such objects are usually used in industrial or construction settings to manage and store large amounts of wire or cable efficiently. As it is placed on the side of the road and does not appear to be moving or posing a direct threat to the roadway, its influence on the future driving behavior of the ego car is minimal. The driver should stay vigilant as such industrial items near the roadway could indicate nearby construction or maintenance work which may affect driving conditions or require slowing down due to temporary signage or workers nearby.",
