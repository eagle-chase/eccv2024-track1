It is equipped with a hydraulic arm and digging bucket, typically used for heavy tasks such as digging, demolition, and material handling at a construction site. The presence of this construction vehicle on or near the roadway indicates potential roadwork or construction activity ahead. This could influence the future driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating reduced speed, heightened alertness, and readiness to obey any temporary traffic signs or directions from road workers. Additionally, the ego car may need to change lanes or adjust its route to accommodate for any road blockages or changes in traffic patterns due to the construction activities.",
