This truck's size and position require the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be ready to stop or maneuver around it. Additionally, there are red and white Chinese character boards attached to a blue barrier on the right side of the road, likely indicating road construction or a closed lane ahead. These signs may necessitate the ego car to merge left or reduce speed. Furthermore, a row of blue and white striped barriers runs along the right side of the road, possibly marking a pedestrian walkway or construction area. These barriers restrict the ego vehicle's ability to maneuver to the right and suggest a narrowed roadway ahead, necessitating cautious driving."

The primary purpose of a bollard in traffic management is to control or direct road traffic, preventing access to certain areas by vehicles while allowing pedestrian access. In the context of driving behavior for the ego car, the presence of these bollards indicates a separation of lanes or areas that are not accessible by vehicles. The ego car must remain within the proper driving lanes and not attempt to cross over or drive through these bollards, ensuring safety and adherence to traffic layouts.",

It is also important to maintain awareness for any sudden movements or actions from the truck, construction workers, or other road users that may emerge from behind the barriers."
