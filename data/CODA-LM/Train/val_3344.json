This vehicle is stationary but its hazard lights suggest that it might start moving or that loading or unloading activities could be happening around it, which could affect the driving behavior of the ego car.\n\nAdditionally, there is a yellow triangular warning sign ahead of the parked delivery truck on the right side of the road. This sign indicates a pedestrian crossing zone and a speed limit of 30 km/h, signaling that the ego car must slow down and be prepared to stop for pedestrians.\n\nIn the distance, there is a traffic light showing a green signal. This green light means the ego car has the right of way to proceed, but caution is still required due to the pedestrian crossing warning.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image."
