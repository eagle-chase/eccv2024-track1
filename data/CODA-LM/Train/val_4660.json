This truck's proximity and size may limit the ego car's maneuverability and obscure the driver's view of the road ahead, including other vehicles and traffic signals. Additionally, there are several cars around the ego car, such as a white van on the left and a small sedan ahead, contributing to traffic density, which may impact the ego car's speed adjustments and lane choices.\n\nMoreover, a motorcyclist is seen beside the ego car, slightly ahead. Given their vulnerability due to less protection, the ego car needs to exercise caution to avoid any unsafe lane changes near the motorcyclist.\n\nOn the roadside to the right, a no left turn sign is visible above the traffic light, restricting the ego car from making a left turn at the intersection and thus influencing its route decision. The traffic lights ahead display a red light, necessitating that the ego car must stop at the intersection until the light changes to green to proceed safely.\n\nFurthermore, metal barriers are placed beside the road to the right, forming a boundary that the ego car should not cross to ensure pedestrian safety and smooth traffic flow. Lastly, several trees are lined along the roadside, which may affect road visibility during windy or severe weather conditions, as falling leaves or branches could potentially obstruct both visual and physical road conditions."
