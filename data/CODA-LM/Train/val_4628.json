        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are two vehicles present. Firstly, a green bus is located on the left side of the image, which is near a bus stop and appears to be stationary. The presence of this bus is significant because it might start moving unexpectedly or let off passengers who could cross the road, therefore the ego car must remain cautious. Secondly, there is a construction vehicle, specifically a paver, situated in the central part of the image. This vehicle is occupying the right lane and partially extends into the middle lane. Due to its size and position, it restricts the available road width and could lead to traffic slowing down or coming to an unexpected stop. Therefore, drivers need to be vigilant and possibly adjust their route.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, barriers, or other objects reported in this image.\n\nHowever, there is a traffic light visible on the right side, showing a green light. This allows the ego car to proceed, but given the large vehicles and potential for pedestrian movement due to the stationary bus, drivers should continue with care.\n\nIn addition, multiple traffic cones are set up around the construction vehicle. These cones serve as indicators for a shift in traffic flow and are meant to direct vehicles safely around the construction area."
