A digital display showing the bus timetable is seen on the right side of the road. Although this sign is important for bus drivers and passengers, it does not directly impact the driving behavior of the ego car.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the road, orange traffic cones are aligned to demarcate the bus lane. These cones serve to clearly distinguish the area and suggest restrictions on road usage, which may be unsafe or prohibited for other vehicles.\n\nAdditionally, there are metal barriers installed along the edge of the pedestrian pathway beside the road. Their purpose is to prevent pedestrians from unintentionally entering the roadway, thus minimizing the potential for accidents.\n\nFurther attention is drawn to the rows of leafless trees along the roadway. These trees could obscure peripheral vision or cause debris to fall during windy conditions, necessitating increased alertness from the ego car to evade unexpected obstacles on the road."
