It is brightly colored, often in vivid oranges or reds, and marked with reflective stripes. Traffic cones are utilized to denote areas where vehicles should not pass or to channel traffic flow into specific lanes. In this instance, the presence of the traffic cone on the roadway suggests that there may be road work ahead, an obstacle on the road, or that a particular section of the road is temporarily closed or hazardous. Consequently, the ego car should reduce speed and proceed with increased caution, possibly moving to another lane if the situation and road signs indicate it is required or safer.",
