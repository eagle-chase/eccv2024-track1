Specifically, there are several vehicles parked on both sides of a wet road, with their hazard lights activated. The presence of these parked vehicles narrows the drivable area of the road and signals a potential obstacle ahead. The activation of the hazard lights serves as a caution for drivers to proceed carefully. No vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in this scenario."
