It occupies part of the adjacent lane and is angled in a way that suggests it may be turning or maneuvering. This position and operation of the truck pose a potential hazard due to its encroachment into the roadway, which could lead to sudden stops or required evasive maneuvers by other road users.\n\nAhead of the ego vehicle, multiple vehicles are parked on the side of the road. Additionally, there are oncoming vehicles in the opposite lane. The parked vehicles narrow the drivable roadway, and the presence of oncoming traffic necessitates that the ego vehicle remains in its lane, thereby reducing maneuverability.\n\nFurthermore, there are red and white striped barriers along the left edge of the road, indicating a closed section or construction area. These barriers define the drivable area's boundaries and limit maneuvering space, signaling that the ego vehicle should proceed with caution and possibly at a reduced speed."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle equipped with a crane arm. It is a large vehicle commonly used in construction and maintenance activities on roads or nearby sites. Based on its structure and the crane arm extension into the air, the vehicle is capable of performing tasks such as lifting heavy materials and equipment. In a traffic scenario, the presence of this type of vehicle often signifies ongoing construction or maintenance work which may lead to disruptions such as temporary lane closures, reduced speed limits, or altered traffic patterns. Consequently, the ego car must remain alert, reducing speed and being prepared for sudden stops or detour signs. Furthermore, the extended crane arm represents a potential hazard that requires additional spatial awareness from the ego car to avoid collisions.",

Additionally, the ego vehicle should be prepared to stop or maneuver carefully due to the reduced road width caused by the parked vehicles and barriers, and monitor for any oncoming traffic to avoid conflicts. Given these conditions, it is advised to reduce speed and increase awareness of the surroundings to allow for safe reaction time to any sudden changes."
