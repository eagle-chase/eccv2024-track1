Use low-beam headlights to enhance visibility without blinding other drivers. If the vehicle is equipped with fog lights or enhanced night vision systems, use them accordingly. Stay alert for reflective signs that could indicate the presence of other road users or important traffic instructions. Prepare to stop or maneuver cautiously if clearer visual information becomes available indicating the need to do so."
