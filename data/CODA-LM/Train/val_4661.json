A white sedan directly ahead of the ego vehicle, positioned on the right lane. This sedan directly influences the driving path of the ego car, requiring either slowing down or lane adjustments to maintain safe distance.\n  2. An orange excavator to the left near a construction site, active but stationary. The presence of heavy machinery near the roadside indicates construction activity which may cause sudden obstructions or require reduced speeds.\n  3. A blue truck partially visible in the background, parked on the left side. The truck is parked but due to its size and position, it narrows the navigable road width and could obstruct view and movement.\n\n- **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n  - A pedestrian, a man wearing a red cap and jacket, standing in front of the construction barrier, slightly oriented towards the road. His proximity to the road and potential to enter the driving lane poses a risk requiring vigilance and possibly slowed speed.\n\n- **Traffic Signs**:\n  - A yellow traffic sign on a pole to the right, indicating 'No disobeying' related to U-turns. This sign informs of prohibited U-turns ahead, guiding the ego vehicle to adhere to forward movement restrictions.\n\n- **Traffic Cones**:\n  - Orange traffic cones visible around the excavator, indicating a demarcated construction area. These cones signal a modification to traffic flow and lane access, necessitating careful navigation to avoid the construction zone.\n\n- **Barriers**:\n  - Green metal barriers enclosing the construction area to the left, near the sidewalk. These barriers delineate the construction space, limiting access and ensuring the road space is narrowed, requiring cautious driving.\n\n- **Other Objects**:\n  - Debris around the excavator and construction area, includes dirt and fragmented materials.
