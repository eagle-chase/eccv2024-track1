It is constructed from metal material and features spokes that radiate from the center hub to the outer rim, enhancing its strength and providing support for the weight of the cable wound around it. In the given driving scenario, its presence beside the road does not directly affect the vehicle's movement unless a potential hazard occurs, such as parts of it falling onto the roadway or obstructing visibility. However, its stationary placement and size mean that it is unlikely to present an immediate hazard under normal circumstances.",

Its size and structure suggest that it may be made of durable materials suitable for industrial use. In this scenario, while the spool is located off the roadside and does not directly influence the ego car's immediate driving path, it does represent a potential hazard. If not properly secured, such spools could roll or shift, potentially entering the roadway. This would require the ego car to remain vigilant and possibly adjust speed or change lanes to avoid unexpected obstacles.",
