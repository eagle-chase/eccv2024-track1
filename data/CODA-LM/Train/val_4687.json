Firstly, there is a white truck on the left side of the ego vehicle, with only its rear visible, which suggests that it might be stationary or moving slowly. Due to the truck's proximity, the ego vehicle must exercise caution in case the truck starts to turn or merge into the ego vehicle's lane.\n\nAhead of the ego vehicle, in the same lane and facing the same direction, there is a maroon car. This car's behavior is important as it influences the ego vehicle's speed and movement; a safe following distance must be maintained.\n\nOn the right side of the lane, there is a cyclist moving parallel to the road. The presence of the cyclist means that the ego vehicle may need to be ready to slow down or change lanes if the cyclist needs to avoid obstacles and enters the travel lane.\n\nAdditionally, the traffic light in the image is red and has a countdown timer displaying '14', which indicates the remaining time until the light changes. The ego vehicle is required to stop at the red light and wait for it to turn green before proceeding."
