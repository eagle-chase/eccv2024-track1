This vehicle's notable size and heavy load suggest that it may travel at reduced speeds or may execute unforeseen maneuvers. Given its occupation of more than one lane, it is plausible that the crane truck is either preparing to change lanes or setting up for an operation nearby."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, specifically a truck equipped with what appears to be a crane or lifting equipment. This type of vehicle is typically used in construction sites for transporting and handling heavy materials. In the context of driving behavior, the presence of a construction vehicle on the road typically suggests possible nearby construction activities. Drivers, including the ego vehicle, should therefore be alert for potential obstacles or changes in traffic patterns, such as reduced lanes or sudden stops. It is advisable for drivers to reduce speed and increase following distance when near such vehicles to accommodate unexpected maneuvers or stops.",

If possible and safe, considering changing lanes to the left to avoid being too close to the crane truck."
