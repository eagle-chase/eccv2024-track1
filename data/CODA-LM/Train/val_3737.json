A white sedan is located in the adjacent lane on the left side of the ego car, necessitating a safe distance to be maintained due to its close proximity.\n2. A white van in the same lane ahead of the ego car is traveling in the same direction, which means the ego car should stay alert for any sudden changes in the van's speed or if it brakes unexpectedly.\n3. To the far left, a blue truck indicates the busyness of traffic; the ego car needs to be aware of it as the truck could potentially change lanes or affect traffic flow.\n4. There are multiple cars on the right, moving alongside the ego car, requiring monitoring for possible lane changes and to help keep traffic flowing smoothly.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n1. A cyclist is near the curb on the right-hand side, heading in the same direction as the vehicles, prompting the ego car to be vigilant for any sudden cyclist moves into the traffic.\n2. Pedestrians are spotted on the left sidewalk, beyond the yellow barriers, moving parallel to the road. The ego car should remain watchful for any pedestrians that might unexpectedly step onto the road.\n\nTraffic Signs:\n- There are no traffic signs reported in this visual field.\n\nTraffic Lights:\n- A traffic light in the ego car's line of sight is displaying a green signal, indicating the right of way to proceed. The ego car should, however, continue with care given the density of traffic.\n\nTraffic Cones:\n- A series of bright orange traffic cones set on the left mark a barrier, suggesting ongoing construction or a lane closure. The ego car should be ready to change lanes if required.\n\nBarriers:\n- The left side of the road features temporary yellow construction barriers that create a division between pedestrian space and the roadway. This signals a construction area and the ego car must be alert for any potential hazards or workers in close proximity.\n\nOther Objects:\n- The visual scene does not include any other objects that would impact the driving situation."
