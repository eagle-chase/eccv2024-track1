These cars are closely parked in side bays, facing perpendicular to the ego car's direction. Due to the density and proximity of these parked vehicles, there is the possibility that other cars might maneuver out without ample warning, which necessitates cautious and attentive driving by the ego car.\n\nAdditionally, there is an unaccompanied medium-sized dog walking across the driving aisle directly in front of the ego car. Since animals are unpredictable and can change direction or speed abruptly, this presents a risk for accidents if not noticed and responded to in a timely manner.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects observed in this image."
