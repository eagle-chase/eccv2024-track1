Firstly, there is a large cement mixer truck directly in front of the ego car. This truck occupies the majority of the lane and has a rotating drum, indicating that it might be in operation. The presence of this large vehicle directly influences the driving behavior of the ego car due to its size, potential slow speed, and the possibility of sudden stops or turns associated with construction vehicles. Secondly, there are parked cars along the right side of the street. These parked vehicles limit the available space for maneuvers, necessitating that the ego car considers these when planning any potential overtaking or lane changes. Other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, and barriers do not contain any road users in this image and thus do not impact the driving behavior in this scenario."

            "description and explanation": "The object is a large construction vehicle typically used for mixing and transporting concrete. It features a rotating drum, which keeps the concrete mixture fluid and ready to pour. This vehicle might be moving slower than standard traffic or could stop unexpectedly to perform operational tasks. The proximity of the construction vehicle to the ego car necessitates increased caution, potentially requiring the driver of the ego car to slow down and maintain a safe following distance to accommodate sudden stops or changes in the behavior of the construction vehicle.",

Due to the presence of parked cars on the right, avoid maneuvers to overtake unless the opposite lane is visibly clear and it is safe to do so. Continuously monitor the situation for any changes, such as the mixer truck pulling over or initiating a turn."
