These signs are important as they prepare the driver for changes in the road layout and guide them to select the correct lane based on their route.\n\nAlthough there are no traffic lights present that would affect the immediate driving behavior of the ego car, allowing for a steady pace to be maintained, there are traffic cones set up along the right side of the dividing lane, hinting at a potential lane closure or the need for merging, which may require the ego car to change lanes or slow down to accommodate the altered traffic flow.\n\nGreen metal barriers are also visible along the right edge of the roadway, delineating the boundaries of the car's drivable space and promoting lane discipline and driving safety by maintaining distance from possible hazards along the road's periphery.\n\nLastly, the absence of any other objects such as debris, dustbins, or animals means the ego car is not expected to perform any immediate evasive maneuvers, contributing to an undisturbed driving experience."
