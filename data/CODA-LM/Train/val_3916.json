This truck's position and size could potentially reduce visibility and maneuverability for the ego car. Consequently, the ego car might need to change lanes or adjust its speed to maintain a safe driving distance from the truck.\n\nAdditionally, there is a pedestrian visible in the distance on the right side of the road, walking along the road. The proximity of the pedestrian to the roadway could present a potential hazard if they unintentionally step onto the road. Therefore, the ego vehicle should keep an eye on the pedestrian and be ready to slow down or come to a stop if it becomes necessary to ensure safety. \n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

Identified by its heavy-duty structure and equipment attached, such as a crane arm, this vehicle is often slower-moving, and its presence may indicate construction activities nearby. For driving behavior, observing this vehicle necessitates increased caution, potential reductions in speed, and readiness for unexpected stops or detours, enhancing safety near the construction zone.",
