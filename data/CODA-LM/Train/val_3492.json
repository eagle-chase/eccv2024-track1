The precarious placement of its load suggests a potential hazard due to the risk of items falling off, posing a danger to the ego car and other road users.\n\nAdditionally, a green bus is parked on the left edge of the frame, which, while stationary at the moment, must be monitored by the ego car for any movements or the possibility of passengers getting on or off.\n\nTo the right, a pedestrian is present, who is currently moving away from the road on the sidewalk. Even though the pedestrian isn't obstructing the ego car's path, vigilance is necessary in case they unexpectedly step onto the road.\n\nAlthough there are no traffic signs, lights, cones, or barriers within the image that influence the driving scenario, the surrounding urban environment includes various skyscraper buildings. These buildings themselves do not impact driving conditions, but they indicate a densely populated urban area where the ego car should be prepared for complex traffic patterns and the chance of sudden, unforeseen obstructions."

In this scenario, the visibility of the bus's side indicates that it is either parked or moving slowly, possibly picking up or dropping off passengers.
