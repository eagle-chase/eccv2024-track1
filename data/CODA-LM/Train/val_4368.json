        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a large beige dump truck located on the left side, encroaching on the leftmost driving lane. It appears to be either in the midst of a turning maneuver or temporarily stopped. Due to its substantial size and positioning, it could significantly impede the flow of traffic and line of sight for other road users, necessitating cautious driving and speed regulation from the autonomous vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, there are pink and white temporary road barriers situated behind the dump truck. The presence of these barriers is indicative of active construction work or road markings implemented for managing the traffic flow. Consequently, these barriers might lead to lane closures or other restrictions. As a result, the autonomous vehicle may need to alter its course to a different lane or decelerate to ensure safe navigation through the area."

Positioned at the rear side of a large construction vehicle, its presence in the traffic scene suggests active transport or loading activities. For the ego car, this indicates potential delays or obstacles as the forklift may temporarily obstruct the lane or require the ego car to maintain a safe distance to avoid collisions while it maneuvers or workers operate around it.",
