A yellow construction vehicle, specifically a front loader with a large bucket, is parked on the right side of the road. It is facing the ego car and occupies a part of the lane that lies ahead. This situation with the construction vehicle presents a reduction in the available lane width for the ego car and suggests that there may be construction activity taking place nearby, which could affect the path of travel and require caution or a lane change. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects identified in the traffic image."

It is characterized by its large front bucket, which is used for moving or carrying large amounts of material such as soil, sand, and gravel. The presence of this construction vehicle indicates ongoing construction work or the need for heavy material handling nearby. For the ego car, encountering this type of vehicle might require increased caution and potentially reduced speed to safely navigate around the potential obstacles and to accommodate unexpected movements from the construction vehicle or nearby workers.",
