Additionally, a dark blue compact SUV is on the left side of the ego car, approximately parallel in position. The SUV's presence requires the ego car to maintain awareness of its speed and direction to avoid collisions, particularly if a lane change is planned.\n\nThere are multiple orange traffic cones placed in a line dividing the traffic lanes and guiding vehicles through a designated area within a construction zone. These cones indicate changes to normal traffic patterns, informing the ego car to stay within its lane, reduce speed, and prepare for potential hazards.\n\nConcrete barriers are present on both sides of the road, with additional green mesh fencing on the right side. These barriers suggest ongoing road work and necessitate that traffic be confined to specific lanes. The ego car must follow the path outlined by the cones and barriers and remain undistracted.\n\nOverall, the traffic situation includes both vehicles and obstructions that require careful navigation and adherence to modified traffic patterns due to construction activities."

            "description and explanation": "This object is identified as a barrier. Barriers are typically used in traffic settings to block or separate different sections of the road, guide traffic in a certain direction, or close off a construction area. In this driving scenario, the presence of the barrier indicates that part of the road is likely obstructed or designated for specific types of vehicles or activities, which may influence the ego car to slow down, change lanes, or follow specific traffic reroutes controlled by road signs or traffic personnel. Understanding how to respond to barriers is crucial for safe driving and navigation through temporary road layouts or construction zones.",
