The presence of these pedestrians requires careful attention from the vehicle, which may need to adjust its speed or come to a complete stop to ensure their safety.\n\nAdditionally, there is an electronic sign board on the right side of the road. The content displayed on this sign board might be important as it could provide information on road conditions or changes that may affect the vehicle's chosen route or driving behavior.\n\nFurthermore, fences are present along both sides of the road, serving to separate different areas and restrict unauthorized access. These barriers play a critical role in defining the driving path for the vehicle and necessitating adherence to the road's boundaries to avoid any infractions or safety hazards.\n\nInterestingly, no vehicles, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects are present in this traffic scene that would impact the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle."
