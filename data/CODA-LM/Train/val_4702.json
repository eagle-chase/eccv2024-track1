This fire truck reduces the available lanes for traffic, potentially slowing or stopping movement if it is active.\n   - Behind the fire truck in the right lane, there is a white car following the direction of the road. This car might slow down or change lanes, influencing the ego car's decision-making processes based on its movements.\n   - To the far right, a red forklift is situated perpendicular to the road and engaged in unloading or loading activities. Although it's not directly in the traffic flow, it adds to environmental complexity and may prompt sudden pedestrian movement or temporary traffic stops.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users:**\n   - Three pedestrians are walking along the left side of the road, moving in the same direction as the ego car. Their presence near the roadside increases the risk for sudden lane invasions or stops, making it crucial for the ego car to monitor them closely to avoid any potential accidents.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image."

It is designed to move large materials such as bricks, dirt, or structural components from one place to another. In the driving scenario, the presence of this construction vehicle indicates ongoing construction activity, likely causing possible disruptions such as lane narrowing or closed roads. The driver of the ego car should be cautious, reduce speed, and be prepared for sudden stops or detours around the construction area.",

The possibility of vehicles changing lanes or sudden stopping due to the fire truck or pedestrian activity should be anticipated. It's advisable to use the left lane for passing if needed, while constantly monitoring the road for any changes in the traffic pattern."
