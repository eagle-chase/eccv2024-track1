Additionally, a white van is on the extreme left moving in the same direction, necessitating monitoring for sudden lane changes or stops. Furthermore, a yellow truck with a crane is parked on the right side with the crane extending over the road, limiting visibility and accessibility and impacting path planning and traffic flow.\n\nAdditionally, there are red and white traffic cones in the right lane leading up to the truck, indicating a closed lane ahead and requiring the ego car to change lanes if it is in the right lane.\n\nLastly, there are shops and buildings along the roadside which don't directly impact driving but require attention for potential pedestrians who may suddenly cross the road, thus necessitating close monitoring."
