        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there are two notable categories of road users affecting the driving environment of the autonomous vehicle. Firstly, a large truck is positioned slightly ahead of the ego car in the adjacent right lane. The significance of this truck lies in its size and proximity, which could potentially hinder the ego car's ability to safely change lanes to the right or maintain an adequate safety buffer on that side. Secondly, there are orange traffic cones aligned along the right side of the lane, extending forward. These cones indicate a probable lane narrowing or ongoing road work, necessitating that the ego car stay within its current lane and consider adjusting its speed accordingly. The rest of the categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, and other objects are absent from the scene, indicating no impact from these entities in the current driving scenario."
