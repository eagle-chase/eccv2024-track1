This vehicle could potentially cause obstruction in the flow of traffic or indicate an emergency situation, suggesting caution is necessary. Additionally, there are large industrial reels near the edge of the road on the right side.

Typically made from wood, these spools are used for storing and transporting large lengths of electrical cables or wires. The presence of such an object in proximity to the driving area might indicate industrial or construction-related activity nearby. For the ego car, this object serves as a visual cue to be mindful of potential debris or related obstacles on the road, and to prepare for the possibility of encountering heavy vehicles associated with construction or industrial work.",
