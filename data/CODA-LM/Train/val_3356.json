Firstly, there is a white car parked on the right side of the road, facing away from the ego car. This parked car might influence the driving route of the ego car, necessitating a slight deviation to the left to avoid it. Additionally, pedestrians are spotted walking on the right sidewalk towards the ego car. The presence of pedestrians indicates that the ego car should be ready to either stop or slow down if they decide to cross the road.\n\nRegarding traffic regulations, there are no visible traffic signs or traffic lights in the image. This absence suggests that the ego car must adhere to standard road rules and proceed with caution at intersections. Similarly, there is a lack of traffic cones and barriers, indicating no current roadworks or closed sections affecting the driving path.\n\nLastly, there are green and blue trash bins located next to the parked car on the right side of the road. While these trash bins do not immediately obstruct the driving path, the ego car should remain cautious in case the bins are moved or debris is blown onto the road."
