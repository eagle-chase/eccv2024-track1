The presence of the mixer truck means that the ego car must keep a safe distance behind it and be ready to decelerate or come to a halt if the truck does. Additionally, there is a roadwork sign on the right side of the road, which serves to warn the ego car of potential dangers or alterations in the flow of traffic that can be expected due to construction work. Along the right side of the road, there are yellow and black traffic cones arranged, signaling an area that should be avoided by vehicles. This indicates that there might be roadwork or obstructions present, and the delineated area should not be entered. To further emphasize this point, temporary barriers have been installed next to the cones to solidify the restricted zone created because of construction or roadwork in progress, ensuring that vehicles do not encroach into this space."
