Given its size and load, unexpected movements or stops could pose navigational challenges for the ego car.\n3. A small forklift is operating directly in front of the ego car, moving from left to right across the path of travel. The forklift crossing in front creates a potential hazard and may cause the ego vehicle to slow down or stop to avoid a collision.\n4. A blue compact car is positioned slightly ahead of the ego car to the left, visible only from the rear. The presence and behavior of this car in the ego vehicle's lane influence spacing and speed adjustments.\n\n**Vulnerable Road Users:**\n1. A pedestrian is seen crossing the road from left to right at a distance, just beyond the forklift. The pedestrian's presence in the vicinity of the forklift and crossing the road requires attentive monitoring to ensure their safety.\n\n**Traffic Signs:**\n1. Multiple traffic signs are present at a roundabout, including 'No Horn' signs, directional arrows, and others indicating movement restrictions.
