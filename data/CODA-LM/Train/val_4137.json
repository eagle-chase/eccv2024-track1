The closeness of the van is a concern as it presents a potential risk of collision, particularly if either the van or the ego car tries to change lanes or perform any maneuvers. Additionally, there are large industrial cable reels situated on the right side of the road, adjacent to a perimeter barrier. Although these objects are stationary, they could become a hazard if they were to roll onto the roadway or if any parts were to come loose, creating unexpected obstacles for the ego car to navigate."

In this scenario, it is positioned beside the road, not directly affecting the roadway or immediate traffic environment but could pose a potential hazard if not secured properly. For the ego car and other drivers, awareness of such oversized objects near the driving path is crucial as they may require precautionary measures like maintaining a safe distance, especially in scenarios where these objects might become obstacles due to unforeseen circumstances like strong winds or poor securing.",
