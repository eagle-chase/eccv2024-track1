A white SUV is partially obstructing the right lane, positioned diagonally facing slightly towards the lane of the ego car. This SUV's position may indicate a potential lane change or sudden repositioning, which could affect the traffic flow and requires a cautious approach by the ego car.\n  2. A dark-colored car is ahead in the left lane, moving in the same direction as the ego car. This vehicle directly in front could reduce the ego car's maneuverability and available reaction time in case it brakes suddenly or changes lanes.\n  3. Several more vehicles are visible further ahead in both the left and right lanes, maintaining lane discipline. These vehicles contribute to the overall traffic density and flow, influencing the driving speed and lane choice of the ego car.\n\n- **Traffic Signs**:\n  1. There is a billboard over the road, displaying an advertisement. While it's not a regulatory traffic sign, its bright lights and size could potentially distract drivers.\n\nNo pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in the image."

Be prepared for potential maneuvers from the obstructing white SUV in the right lane. Since the road condition appears clear and other vehicles are maintaining lane discipline, continue to observe standard safe driving practices, focusing on the positions and potential actions of nearby vehicles especially the SUV."
