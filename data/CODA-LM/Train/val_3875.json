However, there is one vulnerable road user and some other objects that need to be considered.\n\nA person is standing close to the edge of the road, near some large industrial spools. This individual appears to be engaged in some activity related to the spools and, while not on the roadway itself, is in proximity to possibly step onto the road unexpectedly. This requires caution as the pedestrian movement may be unpredictable and could pose a risk.\n\nAdditionally, there are large industrial spools placed next to the person, just off the side of the road. Though these objects are not blocking the roadway, their presence could reduce visibility or potentially result in items being inadvertently introduced onto the road. The situation dictates that drivers should remain vigilant regarding any unforeseen activities that could affect the conditions of the road."

Its presence can catch the attention of drivers due to its size and unusual placement, potentially causing a brief distraction. As it is located off the roadway and does not pose a physical obstacle to vehicular traffic, the primary influence on driving behavior would be the visual distraction, encouraging drivers to maintain focus and avoid prolonged staring at non-traffic objects.",

Given their placement near the roadside, these reels suggest a nearby industrial activity or construction-related work. For the ego car, the presence of such objects near the road might entail extra caution due to potential vehicle movements associated with the transportation of these items or related operational activities. Additionally, it signals the likelihood of workers in proximity, thereby necessitating a reduced speed and increased vigilance to ensure safety.",

Keep a safe distance from the roadside where the objects and individual are located to allow for adequate reaction time if the situation changes."
