There are several oncoming vehicles visible in the distance with headlights on, approaching from the opposite direction. These vehicles are traveling on their side of the road and should not pose an immediate threat to the ego car, but their presence requires attention in case of unexpected maneuvers. Additionally, there is a white car parked on the side of the road towards the right. While this parked vehicle is not a moving obstacle, it reduces the usable width of the road for the ego car and should be noted in case the ego car needs to change lanes or avoid obstacles.\n\nMotor scooters are parked on the sidewalk on the right side of the road. Although these scooters do not directly affect the immediate path of the ego car, they suggest a potential for pedestrians or riders to emerge onto the road unexpectedly.\n\nOther observed objects include dust or particles visible in the air around the streetlight, possibly indicating rain or snow. This condition affects visibility and road safety, necessitating slower speeds and heightened awareness."

It appears unoccupied and stationary, which suggests that it is parked. The presence of this moped close to the driving lane necessitates cautious driving from the ego car, particularly in maintaining a safe distance to avoid any unforeseen movements, such as the moped potentially being moved into the lane or another vehicle attempting to maneuver around it.",

As with the first moped, its presence near the traffic flow demands careful driving. The ego car should ensure it leaves adequate room while passing in case the moped is either moved onto the road or starts unexpectedly. Additionally, as mopeds can be less stable than cars when parked, a slight tap or nudge can potentially set it into unexpected motion, thus it's important for the ego car to maintain a safe passing distance.",
