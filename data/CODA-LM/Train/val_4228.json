The motorcyclist is wearing a black helmet and has a storage box on the back of the motorcycle. This is an important consideration for the ego car's driving behavior as the motorcycle's presence requires careful monitoring due to their vulnerability and the need for greater following distance and quicker reaction times.\n\nAdditionally, at the intersection, there are circular directional signs to both the left and right, informing the ego car of available routes. This will affect the ego car's lane choice depending on the desired direction of travel after crossing the intersection.\n\nMoreover, a traffic light displaying a red signal is positioned directly ahead of the ego car, demanding the vehicle to come to a complete stop. The ego car must remain stationary until the light turns green to continue safely.\n\nNo other road users such as vulnerable road users, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are reported in this particular traffic image."

It should come to a complete stop at the red light, obeying traffic laws and ensuring safety. Awareness should be maintained for the change of the traffic light and readiness to proceed once it turns green. While waiting, the driver should plan the route based on the directional signs observed at the intersection."
