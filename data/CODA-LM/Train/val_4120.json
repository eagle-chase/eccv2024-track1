Next to the truck, there is an excavator with yellow and brown coloration that extends slightly into the road. These vehicles are involved in some form of construction or maintenance activity, leading to a partial road blockage. This situation results in a reduced lane width available for the ego car to navigate through.\n\nAdditionally, a person is standing on the excavator, seemingly overseeing or engaging in the operation of the vehicle. The presence of this individual not only indicates that work is ongoing but also raises safety concerns. As a result, the ego car must proceed with increased caution to prevent any potential accidents.\n\nDespite the construction activity, there are no visible traffic cones to alert road users of the construction zone. The lack of traffic cones or safety markers to outline the construction area may lead to uncertainty in navigation and lane usage for the ego car.\n\nFurthermore, miscellaneous construction-related materials are scattered near the roadway, adding clutter around the site. These objects could pose risks of road debris, affecting driving conditions and necessitating careful navigation by the ego car to avoid potential hazards."

Use the car's sensors and cameras to continually assess the road conditions and any sudden changes in the traffic patterns or obstacles."
