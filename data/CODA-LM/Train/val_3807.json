Their proximity to the lane means the ego car must be cautious and ready to stop or slow down if needed.\n\nAbove the road, there is a directional sign providing lane guidance, which allows for straight travel or a turn to the right. This sign is crucial for the ego car's navigation and lane selection decisions as it approaches further down the road.\n\nAt an intersection ahead, there is a sequence of traffic lights, all displaying red. This requires the ego car to come to a complete stop at the intersection and wait for the signal to change before proceeding.\n\nStarting from the ego car's position and extending towards the intersection, there is a series of orange traffic cones placed in the right lane. These cones signal a lane closure or roadwork, necessitating the ego car to merge left if it's in the right lane or to stay vigilant if it's already in the left lane.\n\nAdditionally, there is yellow temporary fencing on the right side, in front of where the motorcyclists are standing. This barrier indicates a sectioned-off area for construction or an event, highlighting the importance for the ego car to be mindful of potential obstacles or distractions.\n\nThere are no other objects reported in the scene."
