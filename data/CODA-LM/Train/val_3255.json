The truck appears to be carrying a load covered by a tarp, which suggests the transportation of potentially weather-sensitive items. Given the truck's size and proximity directly in front of the ego car, it will significantly influence the driving behavior of the ego car. The driver of the ego car must maintain a sufficient following distance to ensure safety and accommodate the truck's slower acceleration and longer braking distances. Additionally, overtaking this truck might require more caution and clear visibility ahead due to its length.",
