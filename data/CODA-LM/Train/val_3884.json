        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are two notable elements highlighted. Firstly, a large yellow crane is observed, mounted atop a flatbed truck positioned on the right-hand lane, which is notably extending partially into the left lane. This lane is where the ego vehicle finds itself. The crane and truck assembly is located ahead and to the right of the ego vehicle. The significant size of the crane and its encroachment into the adjacent lane pose a considerable risk, requiring the ego vehicle to either switch lanes or decelerate to avoid potential collisions.\n\nSecondly, the scene includes multiple yellow and black traffic cones arranged in a line that demarcates the lanes, starting near the truck and continuing forward along the lane boundaries. The placement of these traffic cones suggests the presence of road work or necessitates lane merging ahead. This scenario advises the ego car to proceed with caution and be prepared to either merge lanes or adjust its path accordingly. \n\nNo other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or miscellaneous objects are mentioned, indicating their absence in the scenario depicted by the image."
