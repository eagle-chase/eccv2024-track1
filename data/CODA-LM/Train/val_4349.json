        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are several road users and objects present that have implications for autonomous driving:\n\nFirstly, there is a white car on the left side of the road, only partially visible. The presence of this vehicle poses a potential risk as it may influence the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle (referred to as the ego car) if it decides to enter the main road or adjust its position.\n\nAdditionally, there is a row of parked blue trucks on the left side, directly adjacent to the road. These trucks pose a visibility challenge for the ego vehicle. It must be vigilant and drive cautiously to account for any possible road users that might emerge from the gaps between the trucks.\n\nIn terms of traffic control, there is a traffic light on a mobile stand placed in the middle of the road, which is currently showing green. While this green light grants the right of way to the ego car, it alerts the autonomous system to the potential for a temporary and perhaps changing road layout ahead, necessitating a heightened state of alertness.\n\nSupporting the indication of a non-standard traffic situation, there is a set of orange and white traffic cones. These cones are arranged around the mobile traffic light stand and serve the purpose of signaling a detour or modification to the usual traffic flow. The ego car should navigate these changes cautiously, ensuring the safety of its maneuver around what might be a construction zone or a temporary obstruction.\n\nFinally, there is debris and various scattered objects situated on the sides of the road near the parked trucks. This clutter not only poses a risk of becoming hazards if they were to be displaced into the road, but they also restrict vision. This might signify ongoing construction or areas that have not been cleared following work, prompting the ego car to take extra precautions.\n\nNo other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, and barriers are reported in the image, suggesting an absence of these entities in the scene."

Traffic lights are devices used at road intersections and pedestrian crossings to control the flow of traffic. They have lights of different colors (commonly red, amber/orange, and green), each color signaling a different command. A green light indicates that vehicles may proceed if the way is clear. For the future driving behavior of the ego car, the green light means that it can continue driving forward or turn if legally permitted and safe to do so, given other traffic and road conditions.",
