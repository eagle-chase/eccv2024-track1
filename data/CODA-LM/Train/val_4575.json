Both vehicles are moving slowly and are partially obstructing the right lane, which indicates that there might be potential road work ahead. Additionally, there is an orange road work sign placed on the right side of the road before the utility vehicles. This sign indicates that road work or maintenance is in progress and signals the driver to be cautious. It also suggests that the driver should potentially merge into the left lane to avoid the obstruction. Furthermore, a series of orange and white traffic cones start from the utility vehicle and extend towards the road work sign. These cones demarcate the area of road work and suggest that there is a lane closure ahead. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects present in the image."
