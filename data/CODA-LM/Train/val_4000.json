        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are a few notable elements that the autonomous driving system must consider. Firstly, there is a dark sedan directly ahead of the ego car, occupying the same lane and traveling in the same direction. This vehicle directly influences the ego car's speed and following distance. The ego car must maintain a safe distance to prevent collision and react appropriately to the sedan's braking or turning signals.\n\nAdditionally, multiple heavy vehicles and construction equipment, such as excavators, are parked on the right side of the road. These stationary vehicles could potentially obstruct the view and restrict lane usage for the ego car. As a result, the autonomous system should moderate speed cautiously and remain alert for any unexpected movements or obstructions from these areas.\n\nLastly, while a street light is visible, there are no traffic lights present in the image. Without visible traffic lights, the ego car must rely on other cues such as road markings, signs, and general right-of-way rules to navigate safely.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
