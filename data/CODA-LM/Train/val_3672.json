The truck, loaded with black tires, may present falling hazards if the tires are not properly secured, thus requiring the ego car to be ready for speed adjustments and potential maneuvering.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, or signals present in this image.\n\nOn the left side of the road, multiple orange traffic cones are set up, signaling either ongoing construction or a closed lane. This arrangement mandates that the ego car maintains its position in the right lane and possibly adjust its speed according to changes in the lane width and road conditions.\n\nFurthermore, concrete barriers, accompanied by green netting, are also situated on the left, encroaching into the construction zone. These barriers emphasize the necessity for cautious driving due to the ongoing construction, which may lead to narrowed lanes and altered road pathways.\n\nLastly, other objects like a pile of construction materials and a significant mound of earth are covered with a green tarp, also on the left side. This is indicative of construction activity in the area and adds further hazards such as falling debris or unexpected movements of construction machinery that the ego car must be wary of."
