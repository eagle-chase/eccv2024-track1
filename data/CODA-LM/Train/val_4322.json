        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are several key elements that stand out, affecting the driving behavior of the ego vehicle. Firstly, there is a traffic sign present; it is a blue directional sign located overhead, indicating 'Daily Parking (P4)' with an arrow pointing towards the right. This sign is crucial as it directs drivers towards the parking area P4, influencing their decision-making regarding lane choice and potential turns.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic light observed on a post to the right, displaying a red light. This red light is a critical signal for vehicles, indicating that they must stop at this point. The presence of the red light directly impacts the ego vehicle's behavior, necessitating a halt to comply with traffic rules.\n\nFurthermore, the image includes red and yellow plastic barriers arranged in a line, blocking a part of the approach lane. These barriers are significant as they signify a blocked or restricted lane, guiding the ego vehicle to adjust its lane position accordingly to avoid the obstacle and maintain a safe driving path.\n\nThese elements combined - the directional parking sign, the red traffic light, and the lane-blocking barriers - play a significant role in influencing the driving behavior of the ego vehicle, dictating its immediate actions and decisions on the road."

They are placed in a line and are commonly used for controlling or limiting vehicle movement, guiding traffic flow, and protecting road workers or pedestrians in areas of potential hazard. Their presence influences the ego car's driving behavior by necessitating either a stop or a maneuver around the designated restricted zone to ensure safe navigation through the area.",
