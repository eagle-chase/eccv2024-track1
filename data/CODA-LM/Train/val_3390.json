These parked trucks not only reduce the available road width but also may obscure potential hazards. Secondly, a red taillight is visible ahead on the road, indicating the presence of a likely moving vehicle. This vehicle could be moving slower or possibly stopping, which necessitates the ego car to adjust its speed accordingly.

These trucks, commonly used for transporting goods, are noticeable by their large size and container section at the back. For future driving behavior, the presence of the truck indicates the need for caution, particularly in maintaining a safe distance. The ego car should adjust speed accordingly and be alert for any sudden movement from these trucks or other nearby vehicles, ensuring a safe passing maneuver.",
