        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are several elements affecting the driving condition:\n\nVehicles: The scene includes a white minivan located in the left lane ahead and slightly to the right of the ego car, which could potentially influence the ego car's driving path depending on the minivan's maneuvers like lane changes or deceleration. Additionally, multiple cars are present in both lanes ahead, including a white sedan on the far right. The behavior of these vehicles will determine the flow of traffic and will impact the ego car's speed and lane choice.\n\nTraffic Signs: There are blue directional signs overhead across the lanes. These signs provide information on upcoming exits or directions, with one sign listing 'Airport' and another sign that is not clearly legible. The signs are key for navigational decisions that the ego car might need to undertake soon.\n\nTraffic Cones: A line of orange traffic cones demarcates the boundary between the right lane and a cordoned-off area to the left side. This arrangement signals an upcoming lane narrowing or closure, indicating that the ego car may have to alter its lane position or engage in merging if required.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects reported in the traffic image that would affect the autonomous driving system."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a traffic cone typically used to direct or restrict movement on the road by designating areas where vehicles are not allowed to go. The cone is bright orange, enhancing its visibility, and often used in road construction sites or to guide traffic around temporary hazards. Such cones play a crucial role in maintaining vehicle organization and can influence the driving behavior of the ego car by requiring it to maneuver around the designated area, adhering to lane shifts, or slowing down in construction or emergency zones.",

Traffic cones are typically used to signal temporary changes in traffic patterns, such as construction zones or roadwork areas. In this scenario, the presence of the cone suggests that there may be a temporary redirection of traffic or a specific area that vehicles need to avoid. As a result, the future driving behavior of the ego car should include slowing down and preparing to possibly change lanes or navigate around an obstruction.",
