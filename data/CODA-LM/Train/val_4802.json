It is bright orange with a white reflective band for high visibility. Traffic cones are often used to redirect traffic, demarcate construction areas, or to signal road users to reduce speed due to potential hazards ahead. In this scenario, the presence of the traffic cone indicates that part of the road may be closed or under repair, requiring vehicles to maneuver carefully around it. This will likely influence the ego car's driving behavior by necessitating reduced speed and increased caution to safely navigate past the cone while maintaining awareness of nearby traffic and road workers.",
