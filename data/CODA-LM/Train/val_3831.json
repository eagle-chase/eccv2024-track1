Directions for upcoming roads are given by the signs located above the middle traffic lane further down the road, which will assist in determining if a lane change is necessary for the ego vehicle. At the immediate intersection ahead, the absence of traffic lights suggests the need for the ego car to heed right-of-way rules and proceed with caution. \n\nOn the right side of the road, orange traffic cones direct the traffic away from an area that appears to be obstructed, implying that there may be a road hazard or construction work, and the ego car should remain on the left side to avoid the blocked-off area. Additionally, white barriers with red stripes are set before the ego car, outlining a checkpoint or tollbooth area, requiring careful navigation through the controlled traffic flow.\n\nLastly, there is a roadside booth near the no parking sign on the right side, which, while not directly impacting driving behavior, requires vigilance to any potential sudden pedestrian activity in this vicinity."
