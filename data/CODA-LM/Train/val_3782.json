        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several road users and objects that are noteworthy. Firstly, there is a white sedan parked on the left side of the road. It is not parked entirely on the sidewalk and is partially blocking a rainwater puddle. The positioning of this sedan may lead other road users to navigate around it, which could result in them moving into the path of the ego car, thus requiring careful attention.\n\nAdditionally, a brown minivan is parked on the right side of the road, parallel to the sidewalk. While this vehicle is parked correctly, its presence, along with that of the white sedan, reduces the available width of the drivable road, which could affect traffic flow and potentially the ego car's maneuvering space.\n\nFurthermore, there are two small, light-colored dogs running across the road directly in front of the white sedan. The dogs' unpredictable movements present an immediate potential hazard. The ego car must be prepared to react to ensure the safety of these vulnerable road users.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
