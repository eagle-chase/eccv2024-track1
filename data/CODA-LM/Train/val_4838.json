These barriers are channeling the flow of traffic and may also suggest nearby pedestrian activity, signaling the need for heightened awareness.\n\nLastly, there is a red bus-like structure positioned on the left. Though it appears to be a stationary object that does not interfere with the driving path, it could be misidentified as a vehicle under poor lighting conditions. Despite this, it currently does not influence the driving behavior and can be acknowledged as a landmark."
