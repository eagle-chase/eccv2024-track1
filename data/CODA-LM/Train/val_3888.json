It features a rotating drum on the back that keeps the concrete mix from hardening as it transports it to construction sites. The presence of such a vehicle on the road indicates construction activity nearby, which may affect traffic flow. Drivers near this vehicle should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential stops or slow movement, especially when the vehicle is maneuvering to perform construction tasks or when entering or exiting a construction site.",

Consider a slight shift to the left within the lane, if possible and safe, to maximize visibility and space between the car and road users on the right."
