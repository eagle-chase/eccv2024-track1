Firstly, there is a white sedan in the left lane, moving in the same direction as the ego car. The presence of this vehicle is essential as it could affect lane choice and speed for the ego car, which may need to overtake or maintain distance based on the sedan's speed.\n\nAdditionally, there is a bent and possibly damaged traffic sign on the right side of the road before the turning lane. The damage to the sign could make it challenging to read, leading to possible confusion regarding road directions or regulations. This could complicate the navigation decisions for the ego car as it progresses along the road.\n\nMoreover, aligning the road are traffic cones set up to form a barrier between the turning lane on the right and the straight lanes. These cones suggest that the turning lane might lead to a construction zone or a controlled area, directing the ego car to stay on the straight lanes unless it needs to turn.\n\nNo other vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects are present in the image that would affect the driving conditions for the ego car."
