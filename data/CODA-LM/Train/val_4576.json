Additionally, yellow barriers are visible in front of the ego car, suggesting that a lane might be closed or restricted. These barriers are used to guide traffic away from hazardous or inactive areas, thus helping to prevent accidents.

            "description and explanation": "This object is a traffic cone, typically made from a combination of plastic and rubber, featuring a high-visibility color such as orange with a white reflective sleeve for easy visibility at night or in low-light conditions. Traffic cones are commonly used to signal areas where drivers should be cautious, often indicating temporary hazards, construction zones, or changes in traffic patterns. For the ego car, recognizing and responding appropriately to this cone is crucial as it indicates the need for a potential reduction in speed and an increased awareness of the surroundings to safely navigate past any nearby hazards or changes in the road layout.",

It is generally cone-shaped, brightly colored for visibility, often in orange, and may have reflective strips to enhance its visibility at night or under low light conditions. In the driving scenario, the presence of this traffic cone suggests that there may be construction, an accident ahead, or a part of the road that is closed for some reason. The ego car will need to reduce speed and may need to change lanes or navigate around the cone carefully to ensure safety and compliance with road regulations.",
