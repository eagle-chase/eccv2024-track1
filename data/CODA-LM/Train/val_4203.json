        "description and explanation": "The image under observation shows that there are several parked cars on the right side of the road, which come in varied models and colors, predominantly dark shades. Although these vehicles are stationary and are not directly affecting the traffic flow, they pose potential risks that must be considered. Drivers must exercise caution when maneuvering around these cars, as there is a possibility of drivers suddenly entering or exiting parking spaces.\n\nThere is also a traffic light visible in the distance displaying a red signal. This is an indication for the ego vehicle to come to a halt and remain stationary until the signal changes to green, permitting safe passage through the intersection.\n\nAdditionally, the image includes trash bins placed on the roadside in close proximity to the parked cars. The presence of these bins is noteworthy as they can conceal potential hazards, including unexpected pedestrian movements. Moreover, the trash bins reduce the effective width of the passable lane, necessitating a higher degree of attentiveness when driving past this area.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or barriers are identified in the image."
