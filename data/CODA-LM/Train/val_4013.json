It is moving in the right lane adjacent to the ego car. The condition and load of the truck are of particular interest as they might affect its maneuverability and braking efficiency, which poses a potential risk to nearby vehicles, including the ego car. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a portion of a large vehicle, specifically a side view of a commercial truck carrying construction materials. The object area shows the body and chassis of the truck, which appears to be old and worn, with visible rust and patches. The presence of this truck on the road influences the driving behavior of the ego car by potentially increasing the need for cautious driving due to the truck's size and the possibility of debris falling from its load. It is crucial for the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be ready for slow vehicle speeds or sudden stops from the truck.",
