The first is a large red truck on the left side, adjacent to the ego car, loaded with construction equipment and materials. The size and proximity of the truck may obstruct the ego car's view of the adjacent lane, potentially hiding other vehicles or road users. The second vehicle is a cement mixer truck directly in front of the ego car, identifiable by its rotating drum and the markings 'A9635K'. The cement mixer's position and operation necessitate that the ego car adjust its driving speed and following distance to account for possible debris falling from the truck and to prepare for any sudden stops.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image.\n\nHowever, there is a traffic light visible over the top of the cement mixer truck, which is displaying a red light. This red light requires the ego car to stop and wait for it to change to green before proceeding, ensuring that traffic rules are followed and safety is maintained.\n\nAdditionally, the surrounding environment includes high-rise buildings and some small greenery along the road. While these objects do not directly influence the driving decisions, they are part of the environmental context of the scene."
