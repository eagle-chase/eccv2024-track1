However, various road signs and barriers are present, which significantly influence navigational decisions.\n\nAn electronic display sign showing Chinese characters is visible, likely conveying important details such as road closures, construction updates, or changes in traffic conditions that are critical for the autonomous vehicle's driving strategy.\n\nAdditionally, there is a yellow and black striped barricade on the right side of the road. The presence of the barricade indicates there might be a roadblock or construction area ahead, requiring the autonomous vehicle to proceed with caution and possibly alter its path.\n\nThe road is also marked with striped orange and white traffic cones aligned on the right side, guiding the ego car along a specific route. This suggests that there may be a temporary change in the regular road layout or a reduction in available lanes, which must be taken into account when planning the vehicle's movements.\n\nFinally, solid yellow barriers equipped with reflectors are located on the left side of the road. These barriers indicate a separation in the road or demarcate a zone off-limits to the ego car, reinforcing the need for the autonomous system to steer clear of these areas."
