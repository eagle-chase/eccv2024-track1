The first is a blue flatbed truck located in the right lane, which is dangerously overloaded with rusty metal sheets that are sticking out. This condition presents a serious safety hazard as there is a risk of debris falling onto the road, which could be perilous for other road users nearby. \n\nAdditionally, there is a cement mixer truck situated ahead in the right lane. It is slightly shifted towards the left side, indicating the possibility of a lane change. The considerable size of this truck alongside its positioning has the potential to block the line of sight for other drivers. Furthermore, if the truck does merge, it could necessitate others to alter their speed or switch lanes to maintain safe driving conditions.\n\nNo other road users such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in the image, as indicated by the absence of data in these categories in the JSON provided."
