        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there is a large yellow construction crane vehicle equipped with heavy machinery, which is taking up most of the road ahead in the same lane as the ego car. The crane extends both horizontally and vertically, encroaching on parts of the adjacent lane. The presence of this crane requires the ego car to exercise increased caution due to the potential for sudden movements or parts of the crane extending unexpectedly.\n\nAdditionally, there is a pedestrian dressed in light-colored clothing walking to the right at the side of the road. The pedestrian is in close proximity to the road and seems to be crossing behind the crane. The ego car must be vigilant and ready to stop or slow down since pedestrians can unpredictably step into the driving lane, posing a risk of accidents.\n\nFurthermore, metal barricades are present along the left side of the road, separating the sidewalk from the road. These barricades are in place to ensure that both vehicles and pedestrians remain within their designated areas. They also restrict the ego car's ability to make left maneuvers in case it needs to dodge unexpected obstacles on the road.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the scene."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle typically used for heavy-duty tasks in building and maintenance projects. It is large, has a robust body, and includes specialized equipment attached to its top section. The presence of this construction vehicle on the road indicates potential construction activity ahead or in the vicinity. For the ego car, this suggests the need for heightened awareness and possibly reduced speed to navigate safely around the vehicle and any possible construction zones. It also suggests that there may be temporary changes in traffic patterns, such as lane closures or detours, and the driver should be prepared to follow traffic signs or directions from construction personnel.",

Additionally, the ego car should monitor the pedestrian at the right side of the road and be ready to stop if the pedestrian steps into the driving lane."
