        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are several elements that are affecting the driving conditions. Firstly, there is a white van partially parked in the driving lane with its hazard lights on. This vehicle is causing an obstruction in the lane, which could lead to traffic slowing down or necessitating a lane change for vehicles to pass by safely.\n\nAdditionally, there is a series of vehicles parked on the side of the road to the right. The rear of these vehicles is visible to the ego car. The presence of these parked vehicles narrows the available driving lane and requires extra vigilance to anticipate any sudden movements, such as a car door opening or a pedestrian stepping out from between the parked cars.\n\nFurther ahead, the red tail lights of cars are visible, indicating the presence of traffic flow or potential congestion. This suggests that the ego car may need to adjust its speed or be prepared for possible stop-and-go traffic conditions.\n\nLastly, there is an orange traffic cone placed on the road in front of the van. This cone serves as a marker for an area to be avoided, likely due to the obstructed lane caused by the parked van. It signals that the ego car may need to perform lane changes or other maneuvers to navigate past the obstruction safely.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene that impact driving behavior."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a traffic cone, often orange in color with a reflective strip to ensure high visibility. Traffic cones are used to signal areas to avoid in the road, such as construction zones, hazards, or changes in traffic patterns. This cone specifically indicates a section of the lane that should be avoided, potentially due to road work or a temporary obstruction. In relation to the ego cars future driving behavior, the presence of this cone suggests that the driver should be prepared to slow down and potentially merge into an adjacent lane to safely navigate around the indicated hazard.",

The driver should also be alert for any additional hazards that might arise from the parked vehicles on the road's side. Given the visible tail lights ahead, maintaining a safe following distance from traffic ahead is important in case of sudden stops. Monitoring for any lane mergers or pedestrians that might emerge from between the parked cars should also be part of the situational awareness."
