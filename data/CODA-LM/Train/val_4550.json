This parked vehicle is significant as it could affect the driver's decisions regarding lane choice and overtaking maneuvers.\n\nAdditionally, a motorcyclist, likely an adult, is riding a small motorbike on the right side of the road, adjacent to the parked sedan. The motorcyclist's presence requires attention to their potential movement changes, which could impact the flow of traffic.\n\nThere is also a pedestrian accompanied by a child, crossing the road near some construction cones towards the curb. The need to ensure their safe passage mandates that the ego car moderate its speed and possibly alter its path.\n\nFurthermore, three orange traffic cones have been placed on the right side of the road, suggesting the presence of a road hazard or an ongoing construction area. These cones necessitate a slight lane shift by the ego car to maintain a safe distance from the obstacle.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects are reported in this image."
