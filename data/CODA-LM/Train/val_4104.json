This indicates that the vehicle is either slowing down or stopped, necessitating the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to stop. Additionally, there is debris on the road, specifically multiple colored balloons in the immediate path of the ego car. This presents a potential hazard, as the balloons could cause distraction or become entangled in the vehicle's undercarriage or wheels, affecting its operational capabilities. There are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image."
