The vehicle is parked, and the activities associated with it, such as loading or unloading, could potentially extend into the lane of the ego car, causing an obstruction.\n\nThere are two vulnerable road users in the scene. The first is a pedestrian, who might be a security guard, walking on the right sidewalk and moving parallel to the ego car's direction. There is a risk that this pedestrian could step onto the street unexpectedly. The second individual is near the open SUV, engaged in loading or unloading the vehicle. This person is close to the roadway and might also step onto the road, necessitating careful monitoring by the ego car.\n\nA traffic sign indicating a pedestrian crossing is located on the right side of the road next to the parked SUV. This sign alerts drivers to the presence of a pedestrian crossing point, where they must be prepared to stop and yield to pedestrians.\n\nAbove the pedestrian crossing sign, there is a red traffic light. This light is instructing the ego vehicle and other road users to stop, ensuring that no vehicles move through the intersection at this time.\n\nLastly, there is a utility cart with boxes positioned next to the SUV. The cart and boxes are involved in the loading activities and are placed near the traffic lane, which could lead to unexpected obstructions if any items are dropped or moved into the lane.\n\nThere are no traffic cones, barriers, or other objects affecting the driving behavior of the ego car in this image."
