        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is one black SUV positioned immediately in front of the ego car within the same lane, which is decelerating, as suggested by its activated brake lights. This requires the autonomous system of the ego car to reduce its speed as well in order to maintain an appropriate and safe following distance.\n\nAdditionally, there are several other vehicles moving in the lanes that are parallel to the left side of the ego car. The autonomous driving system must recognize the presence of these vehicles and consequently avoid executing any unsafe lane changes that could lead to collisions or traffic disruptions.\n\nOn the left side of the scene, there is a directional sign informing road users of an impending left bend in the road and possibly a junction. This traffic feature signals to the ego car the need to stay vigilant for any likely alterations in the traffic pattern or unexpected movements from other road users that might occur due to the road's change in direction or the intersection.\n\nFurthermore, there are orange traffic cones placed on the right side of the road, encroaching partially onto the sidewalk and into the street. These cones are indicative of potential obstructions or ongoing roadworks. The ego vehicle is thus alerted to anticipate potential constrictions in the carriageway or deviations in the traffic flow necessitated by these roadworks or obstructions.\n\nThere are no other vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, or miscellaneous objects reported in the image that the ego car would need to consider in its driving decisions."
