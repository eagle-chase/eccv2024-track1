It has visible markings and lights, indicating a construction zone ahead, which likely requires the ego car to change lanes or reduce speed to navigate safely.\n\nAbove the road, there are directional signs indicating that the next exit for Caobao Rd. is in 1 kilometer and there is also an arrow pointing towards Wuzhong Rd. These signs provide information about upcoming exits and suggest that drivers may need to change lanes if they intend to take these exits.\n\nAdditionally, there is an arrow-shaped traffic light displaying a yellow signal on the lane closure sign. This yellow arrow alerts drivers that the lane ahead is merging or closing, which means they should exercise caution and prepare to merge left.\n\nOn the side of the road, there are yellow and black striped crash barriers. These barriers delineate the edge of the road and separate the construction zone from the driving lanes. They serve as a warning for reduced road width and potential hazards near the construction area."

The flatbed truck is equipped with safety markings including reflective stripes and warning lights to enhance visibility.

The ego car should maintain a safe distance from this vehicle and be prepared for possible slowdowns or changes in traffic patterns due to construction activities.
