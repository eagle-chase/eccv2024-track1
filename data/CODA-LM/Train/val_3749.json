While they are not positioned on the roadway, vigilance is required from the ego car in case any individual decides to enter the roadway unexpectedly, posing a possible safety hazard.\n\nLastly, there are temporary structures and chairs on the left side of the road, as well as a light pole positioned close to the edge on the right. None of these objects are currently impeding the traffic lane, but their presence necessitates increased attention from the ego car due to a more complex roadside environment.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers reported in the scene."
