In this traffic scenario, while the spool itself does not directly influence driving behavior, its presence may indicate an industrial area or a zone where construction or maintenance work is plausible. This could suggest to the driver of the ego vehicle to be cautious of potential obstacles or unusual traffic patterns up ahead such as slow-moving heavy vehicles, temporary signs, or workers on or near the roadway.",

For the driving scenario, this object is located on the far-right side of the image, behind the foreground and adjacent to a vehicle. Although it does not impose a direct influence on the immediate pathway of the ego car, its placement in a potentially operational or industrial area suggests the possibility of nearby operational activity such as vehicles or personnel moving these materials. Therefore, the ego car should remain alert for unexpected movements or obstacles related to this industrial setting.",
