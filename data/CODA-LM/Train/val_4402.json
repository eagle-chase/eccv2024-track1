Directly in front of the ego car is a white sedan traveling in the same direction, which affects the ego car's following distance and speed adjustment due to its proximity and speed. Further ahead, an SUV and a dark-colored sedan are also visible through the wet windshield, impacting traffic flow and requiring the ego car to adjust its driving strategy accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, traffic lights are visible ahead, with both green and red lights observable due to the angle and reflections on the wet day. The ego car must carefully monitor these lights to decide appropriately when to stop or go, ensuring it observes the correct light as it approaches the intersection.\n\nThere is also a black umbrella on the road in the ego car's lane, slightly towards the left. This obstacle could pose a risk if struck, potentially causing damage or affecting the car's trajectory, requiring the ego car to possibly take evasive action."
