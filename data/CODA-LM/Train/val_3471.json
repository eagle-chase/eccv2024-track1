This suggests that they might be occupied or about to leave their parking spots. These parked vehicles can obstruct the view of the road and create potential hazards if they move unexpectedly. Additionally, there is a vehicle in the distance with its headlights on, facing our vehicle. It appears to be in an opposite lane. This vehicle may be approaching our car, which could affect the available reaction time for our driver. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in this image."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a large vehicle, specifically a truck, notable for its size and the vertically arranged rows of lights clearly visible in the dark conditions. These lights are an essential indicator of the truck's presence on the road. Its large size and potential slower speed compared to smaller vehicles require that the ego car adjusts its driving behavior by possibly reducing speed and increasing following distance. This adjustment is crucial to maintain safety, especially in low visibility conditions, as it offers more time to react to any sudden changes in the truck's movement.",

Additionally, the headlights of the approaching vehicle should be monitored to ensure it remains in its lane. Finally, extra caution should be taken due to the potentially wet road conditions by increasing following distance and preparing for increased braking distances."
