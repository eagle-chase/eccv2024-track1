However, there is a significant presence of vulnerable road users and traffic signs that the ego car will need to consider.\n\nSpecifically, there's a cyclist on the right side of the road, traveling in the same direction as the autonomous vehicle. The presence of the cyclist is crucial for the driving strategy of the ego car because it will need to either slow down or possibly change lanes, maintaining a safe distance to overtake the cyclist to avoid any potential danger.\n\nAdditionally, a rectangular traffic sign can be seen on the left side of the road at the start of the visible area. Though the signâ€™s exact content is unclear due to its non-reflective surface, it is essential for the ego car to pay attention to it as it might contain important information that could affect the vehicle's driving behavior, like speed limits, directional instructions, or warnings."

For example, if the tricycle is moving slowly or unpredictably, the ego car may need to slow down or potentially change lanes to pass safely when conditions allow.",
