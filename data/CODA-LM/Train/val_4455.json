Its size and positioning may reduce visibility and maneuverability, requiring a cautious approach and a possible lane change if safe. Additionally, a black compact car is parked on the right side facing the ego vehicle. Even though it is not an immediate hazard, its position warrants attention in case it enters the road.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users in this scene.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there are no visible traffic signs that affect immediate driving decisions, requiring the ego vehicle to rely on road markings and common traffic laws.\n\nNo traffic lights are visible in this scene, so the ego car should proceed based on the observed road users and standard driving rules.\n\nSeveral traffic cones are placed to the right, marking road work or an area to avoid.
