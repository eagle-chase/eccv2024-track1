A white bus is parked on the right side, which could re-enter traffic and influence our driving strategy. Beyond the bus, a yellow excavator and several brown bins suggest ongoing construction, potentially affecting lane availability and traffic flow. On the sidewalk near this construction, there's a pedestrian whose actions could pose a hazard if they step onto the road unexpectedly. A traffic sign indicates that buses may turn right, hinting that buses could merge back into traffic lanes from their stationary position. The traffic light at an upcoming intersection is green, granting the right of way but requiring vigilance for any changes. Traffic cones line the right side, marking the construction zone boundary, directing the car to slow down and stay to the left. Wooden barriers and warning tape wrap around the construction site, emphasizing the need to keep a safe distance and be prepared for changes in lane width. Lastly, multiple brown bins are piled beside the excavator, holding materials that could become hazards if not properly secured. The presence of these various elements requires a cautious approach, with attention to potential movements of the bus, pedestrians, and adjustments in reaction to the construction environment."
