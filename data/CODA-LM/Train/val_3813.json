Directly in front of the ego car is a large red truck occupying most of the lane, with a slight shift to the right. The size and proximity of this truck require the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and speed. In the left lane, slightly ahead of the ego car, there is a black sedan. The sedan's position and trajectory could influence the ego car's decisions and timing for lane changes.\n\nAdditionally, there are several vehicles at various distances in the opposite lane. These vehicles need to be watched for any unexpected maneuvers that might impact the ego car's path. On the right side of the road, there are construction vehicles parked. While they are not currently affecting traffic flow, their presence indicates potential construction activity ahead, and the ego car should stay alert for any changes in traffic patterns or road conditions.\n\nFurthermore, there is a green traffic light visible directly over the center of the intersection ahead. This green light signals that the ego car can proceed, but it should also be ready for the light to change and for any crossing traffic as it nears the intersection. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
