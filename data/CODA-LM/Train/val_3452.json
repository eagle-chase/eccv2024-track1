The presence of this truck may cause obstructions in the driving path and limit visibility for the ego car, necessitating caution and possibly a change in the driving path to avoid it. Additionally, there are several traffic cones lined up on the left side of the road. These cones are creating a barrier and suggest that there is a roadwork zone or a closed lane ahead. The ego car should respond to this by staying in the open lane to safely navigate past the indicated roadwork or closure. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
