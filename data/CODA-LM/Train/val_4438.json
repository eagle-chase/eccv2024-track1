This indicates that the taxi may have passengers and could exhibit unpredictable behaviors such as sudden stops or slow driving, necessitating careful speed regulation by the ego car. The second vehicle is a blue tractor positioned to the right side of the road, seemingly involved in construction activities. The tractor's presence suggests that there could be unexpected movements or temporary obstructions, requiring the ego car to exercise caution and be prepared to stop or slow down.\n\nAdditionally, there is a red traffic light visible overhead at the intersection ahead of the ego car. This red light mandates that the ego car must stop, thus influencing the driver to decelerate and prepare for a complete halt.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
