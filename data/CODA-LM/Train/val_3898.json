        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there is a notable presence of construction vehicles, which are specifically a line of yellow construction vehicles positioned on the right side of the road. This lineup includes a significant vehicle, a truck equipped with a crane mounted on its back. The proximity and positioning of these large construction vehicles are consequential as they are partially occupying the lane next to the ego car. This situation necessitates a careful response from the ego car, likely requiring a lane change or a speed adjustment to ensure a safe driving distance is maintained, avoiding any potential hazards that could arise from the closeness to these large vehicles."

The vehicle includes elements such as a crane arm and a cabin mounted on a flatbed truck, indicating its use in construction or engineering work. Its presence on the road necessitates cautious driving by the ego car, potentially requiring a reduction in speed and increased awareness to safely navigate around the construction vehicle, especially since it might make sudden stops or slow movements common in construction zones.",

It has a significant physical bulk and appears to partially extend into the adjacent lane. In the context of driving behavior, the ego car must maintain a safe distance and possibly prepare to slow down or maneuver carefully to avoid getting too close to the construction vehicle. This ensures both safety and compliance with traffic regulations that require vehicles to give way to construction machinery active on or near roadways.",
