Dogs are known for their loyalty and intelligence, and in a traffic environment, their presence can be unpredictable. For the ego car, detecting and identifying a dog is crucial since they can suddenly enter the roadway, potentially leading to a traffic hazard. The driver of the ego car should be prepared to slow down or stop to allow the dog to move safely out of the driving lane, thereby preventing any accidents and ensuring the safety of the animal.",

Additionally, observe the behavior of oncoming traffic to anticipate any changes in the traffic light at the intersection ahead."
