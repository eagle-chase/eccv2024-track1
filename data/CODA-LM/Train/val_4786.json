Its bulky size and position directly affect the maneuvering space and field of vision for the ego car. Additionally, there are several cars to the right of the ego vehicle, in another lane. These cars are potential lateral traffic contenders, and their lane change or turning could impact the ego car's navigation.\n\nVulnerable road users such as cyclists and motorcyclists are seen moving and positioned in front of the ego car, across the intersection. Their presence and potential unpredictable maneuvers in traffic make them critical to monitor for safe passage.\n\nThe traffic image also includes a traffic light visible straight ahead with a red light. This indicates that the ego car and other road users are required to stop, controlling the movement of all vehicles and bicycles.\n\nLastly, the presence of the crane truck and the general environment suggest a construction or working zone. Typically, these zones have reduced speed limits and increased caution advisories, affecting driving behavior. There are no traffic signs, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."

It features a large, mobile platform with a powerful lifting arm, often used in building projects for lifting heavy materials. Its presence on the road demands additional caution from the ego car, as such vehicles often make unexpected stops or movements and may obstruct visibility. Moreover, construction vehicles entering and exiting work sites can affect traffic flow, and drivers should be vigilant near them to avoid accidents.",
