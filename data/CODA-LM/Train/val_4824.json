        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, a white, three-wheeled delivery vehicle is prominently situated on the left side, slightly ahead of the observer's car, with a visible driver inside. This delivery vehicle poses a potential hazard as it occupies the same lane as the observer's car, closely enough to potentially slow down or obstruct the passage. Also, on the left side, a pedestrian, specifically a man, is noticed walking towards the direction of the delivery vehicle. The proximity of this pedestrian to the car's route introduces a risk of him stepping into the vehicle's path unexpectedly. On the right side of the road, direct risks are posed by large cable reels stored near the driving lane. These reels could become dangerous if they were to unexpectedly roll or shift into the lane. The traffic image lacks any traffic signs, lights, cones, or barriers, thereby focusing concerns on the described vehicles, pedestrian, and other objects on the roadside."

For the ego car's future driving behavior, monitoring such vehicles is crucial, especially if the ego car intends to overtake, as the auto-rickshaw could make sudden stops or turns due to its delivery nature.",
