However, there are multiple yellow traffic cones lined up along the left side of the road, indicating a temporary lane blockage. This suggests that there is likely a section of the road undergoing maintenance or reserved for specific use, which restricts the vehicle's accessible road width and could potentially alter the traffic flow.\n\nAdditionally, there are temporary yellow barriers aligned parallel on both sides of the driving lane. These barriers are in place to guide traffic into a specific path, possibly narrowing it and requiring careful driving to stay within the confined path.\n\nFurthermore, there are bright digital billboards on the left side that could be visually distracting. The brightly lit screens might distract the driver, especially at night, and could lead to a safety hazard if the driver is not cautious.
