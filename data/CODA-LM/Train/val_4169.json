There is a white sedan parked on the side of the road, facing the direction of the ego car. It is currently stationary; however, it may potentially join traffic, which requires the ego car to stay vigilant for any movement from the sedan.\n2. A truck is parked on the right side outside a warehouse. The truck appears to be either being loaded or unloaded. While the truck is not a moving obstacle, the associated activity suggests that it will remain stationary. Nevertheless, the ego car must watch out for people moving in the vicinity who could unexpectedly enter the roadway.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n1. A pedestrian is spotted standing on the sidewalk right next to the white sedan that is parked. The pedestrian may decide to cross the road or suddenly enter the street, which means the ego car must proceed with caution in anticipation of such movements.\n2. Near the truck, individuals are observed who are likely workers engaged with the cargo of the truck. Their proximity to the roadway poses a risk if any of them were to move onto the road, urging the autonomous driving system to be cautious.\n\nOther Objects:\nOn the sidewalk, there are various objects, including machinery that seems to be related to the truck's loading activities. These objects are not directly in the travel path of the ego car but are indicative of ongoing work which might influence road conditions and should thus be noted.\n\nIn this specific traffic image, there are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present, and hence they are not addressed in this summarization."
