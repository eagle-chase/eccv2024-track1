This sign indicates that the road ahead only allows traffic to move forward, suggesting no turns are allowed at this intersection.\n\nThirdly, yellow traffic cones are placed in a line, blocking the rightmost part of the intersection. These cones may indicate road work or a temporary road closure, directing the ego car to avoid using the right lane and proceed with caution through the available lanes.\n\nFurthermore, a series of low yellow and black barriers extend from the left corner perpendicular to the ego car's direction. These barriers block any access to the adjacent road, delineating the construction or restricted area. The ego car should maintain a distance and follow the designated road path.\n\nLastly, a guard booth is situated to the right of the ego car, adjacent to the blocked off area. Although stationary and not a direct obstacle for the moving ego car, its presence suggests increased activity or security presence which could influence road conditions or behavior. \n\nThere are no vulnerable road users or traffic lights present in this image."
