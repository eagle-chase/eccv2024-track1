        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are two large trucks positioned directly in front of the ego car, with their cargo beds tilted upwards, causing an obstruction in the lane. These trucks appear to be involved in construction or logistic activities, suggesting that there is an active loading, unloading, or construction site ahead. This situation directly impacts the ego car by blocking its forward path and may lead to traffic delays. Additionally, a black sedan is seen on the right side of the ego car, moving in the same direction and partially visible. The presence of the sedan increases the complexity of the driving scenario, as it occupies the adjacent lane, which might be considered by the ego car for a lane change or speed adjustment. The sedan's movement should be closely monitored to ensure safe maneuvering. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image."

As a public transport vehicle often making frequent stops, the presence of a bus in the driving environment necessitates caution and readiness to adjust speed or stop distances accordingly, as buses can stop suddenly to pick up or drop off passengers, potentially impacting the flow of traffic.",

Observing the situation ahead carefully, especially monitoring any signs of movement from the trucks or changes in the black sedan's path, is critical. If the neighboring lane is clear ahead of the black sedan, signaling early and safely changing lanes would be a prudent choice to bypass the obstruction caused by the trucks."
