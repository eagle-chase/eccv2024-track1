This vehicle directly impacts the ego car's speed and following distance, requiring the ego car to maintain a safe distance and be ready for sudden stops or speed changes.\n\nPedestrians are walking along the sidewalk parallel to the ego car on the right side of the road. Although they are not on the road, the ego car should monitor them closely for any potential road crossings or unexpected entries onto the driving lane.\n\nA green traffic light is directly ahead, signaling that the ego car can proceed. This indicates that the ego car has the right of way but should stay attentive to any light changes and other road users.\n\nAn orange traffic cone is present on the left side of the ego car's lane. This suggests there might be road work or hazards, so the ego car should carefully maneuver around the cone without veering into the adjacent lane or hitting it.\n\nAdditionally, blue construction barriers run along the right side of the road, indicating ongoing work or an area closure. These barriers demarcate a non-drivable area, narrowing the available space and requiring the ego car to stay in its current lane and away from the barriers."
