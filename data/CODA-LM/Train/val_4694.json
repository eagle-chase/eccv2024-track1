It has multiple signal aspects showing, with the green light currently illuminated, indicating permission for vehicles to proceed through the intersection or along the current path they are following. Such signals are vital for managing the flow of traffic and ensuring orderly movement while reducing the risk of collisions at intersections. The presence of this green traffic light will influence the ego car to continue driving forward as long as the signal remains green without stopping or slowing unnecessarily.",
