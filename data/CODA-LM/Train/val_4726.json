The presence of these vehicles necessitates that the autonomous vehicle carefully maneuver and regulate its speed to safely navigate around the moving cars.\n\nA pedestrian, accompanied by two dogs, is crossing the street at a pedestrian crossing. It is crucial for the autonomous vehicle to come to an immediate halt to ensure their safety.\n\nAdditionally, a traffic light displaying a red signal is in view. This requires the autonomous vehicle to remain stationary until the light turns green, in adherence to traffic regulations.\n\nTrees along the sidewalk and various commercial signs that are illuminated are also present. These elements do not require direct action from the autonomous vehicle but are part of the broader roadside environment and could potentially affect visibility and driver focus."
