This combination is directly impacting the navigational path of the ego car, necessitating either a lane change or a reduction in speed to ensure safety. Additionally, several cars with headlights on are driving in the opposite direction in the background. The presence of this oncoming traffic affects the ego car's decision-making, especially if it needs to overtake or maneuver around the truck and excavator, as it requires careful assessment of the opposing lane's traffic flow.\n\nTo the right of the road, there is a large red and white barrier sign with the text \"施工区\" indicating a construction area. This sign serves as a warning of potential hazards due to construction, which means the ego car must exercise increased caution and be ready to stop or follow detour instructions as indicated by road signs or ground markings.\n\nMetal barriers are also present, placed on the right side of the road along the pedestrian walking area. These barriers suggest that there are roadworks or a sectioned-off area, which could influence the traffic flow and reduce the available road width, prompting the ego car to proceed with caution."
