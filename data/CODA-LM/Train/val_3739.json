The barrier serves as a safety mechanism designed to prevent vehicles from entering prohibited or hazardous areas along roadways or bridges. For the ego car, the presence of this barrier dictates that it must not cross into the lane on its left and should instead stay in its current lane or consider overtaking from the right, only if permitted by local traffic laws and conditions.",

If it's safe and legal to do so, the ego vehicle should consider changing to an adjacent lane to bypass the truck, while also being mindful of the barriers to the left that restrict movement to that side. The ego vehicle's sensors and visual systems should be used to check for clearances and ensure it is safe to perform a lane change maneuver."
