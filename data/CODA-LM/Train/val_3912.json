A silver SUV is positioned in the center lane, ahead and to the left of the ego car; its presence could affect the ego car's decision-making regarding overtaking or maintaining speed to ensure a safe following distance. A white hatchback is in the right lane, traveling parallel to the ego car; it demands attention to allow for any necessary adjustments in the ego car's lane position or to anticipate any lane changes the hatchback may undertake.\n\nAdditionally, a single traffic cone is located on the left side of the road, encroaching slightly onto the lane, signaling a possible hazard or lane narrowing, which will require the ego car to adjust its lane position to the right for avoidance. Also, there are continuous protective barriers running along the left side of the highway, which define the road's limits and encourage vehicles, including the ego car, to maintain a safe lateral distance from the edge. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects affecting the driving scene."

It prompts caution and potentially indicates a redirection of traffic flow or a hazard ahead. The presence of this cone necessitates that the ego car and other drivers may need to slow down, merge into adjacent lanes, or become more aware of potential obstacles or workers near the road. Observing this traffic cone is crucial for maintaining road safety and adjusting driving behavior accordingly.",
