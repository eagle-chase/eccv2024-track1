However, there are multiple dustbins positioned alongside the curb, quite close to the road. These dustbins have a potential impact on driving behavior, as their proximity to the driving lane can pose a hazard. Should contents from the bins spill onto the road, or a bin become displaced onto the path of traffic, this could influence the driving decisions of an autonomous vehicle."

The presence of this object in the driving environment poses a potential hazard to vehicles. It can lead to tire damage or cause a driver to swerve unexpectedly if they attempt to avoid it. Therefore, it is important for the ego car to maintain a safe distance from the curb and remain alert for any obstacles, possibly adjusting the driving path slightly to avoid running over such debris.",
