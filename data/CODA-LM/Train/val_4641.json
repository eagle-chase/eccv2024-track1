Likewise, there are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones observed. However, there is a significant white and red horizontal barrier positioned across the road. This barrier is critical as it indicates a blockade, preventing the ego vehicle from continuing along its current pathway and consequently necessitating a stop or a detour to proceed.\n\nAdditionally, there is a large cat sitting on the ground just before the barrier, very close to the potential path of the ego vehicle. This necessitates extra caution or a possible stop from the ego vehicle to ensure the safety of the animal and avoid any harm."
