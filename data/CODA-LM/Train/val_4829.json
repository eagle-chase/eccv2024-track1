It is an important consideration in traffic scenarios because it can affect the speed and maneuverability of other vehicles around it due to its size and the nature of its function. Typically, these vehicles move slower and make frequent stops, especially in areas near construction sites. Drivers in the vicinity, including the ego car, should maintain a safe following distance and be alert for potential abrupt stops or turns by the construction vehicle.",
