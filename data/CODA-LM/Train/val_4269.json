Additionally, the scene is devoid of any traffic signs or other miscellaneous objects that would typically affect navigation.\n\nHowever, the traffic control devices present include a standard three-lens traffic light placed on the left side of the road, which is currently showing a red signal. This indicates the requirement for vehicles to halt and await the green signal before moving forward.\n\nMoreover, the scene contains orange and white traffic cones positioned on the right side of the road, which serve to block entry partially and suggest that there is a segment of the road or area that is currently off-limits, or that drivers should be particularly cautious when driving adjacent to this area.\n\nFinally, there are metal barriers featuring white and red stripes installed along the roadside. These barriers appear to enclose an area to the right of the ego vehicle, signifying the presence of a construction zone or a restricted area that is not available for traffic flow, thus ensuring vehicles do not enter this space."
