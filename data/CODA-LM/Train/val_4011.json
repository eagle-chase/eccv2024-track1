        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there is a large blue truck directly ahead of the ego car, significantly occupying the driving lane. The truck's rear end is visible from the ego car's perspective. This situation necessitates that the ego car maintain a safe distance behind the truck to allow adequate room for any sudden stops or turns the truck might make, thus directly impacting the driving behavior of the ego car.\n\nAdditionally, to the right of the truck, on the side of the road, there are blue and green plastic crates. Their placement, partially encroaching onto the roadway, could pose a hazard. It is important for the ego car to keep an eye on these crates, as they have the potential to move into the path of the vehicle. The ego car must, therefore, be vigilant and ready to perform evasive maneuvers should these objects enter the driving lane. No other road users or traffic elements such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are present in the image."
