The presence of these signs means that the ego car must not continue forward on this path.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple orange and white reflective traffic cones arranged in a line across the road lanes. These cones are directing traffic away from a certain area, suggesting that there may be a change in traffic patterns or a road closure ahead. As a result, the ego car is required to follow the new designated path or come to a stop.\n\nFurthermore, there are yellow and black striped barriers on the road, which likely denote construction work or road maintenance. These barriers create a physical boundary that the ego car is obliged to respect and not cross, indicating that a section of the road is impassable.\n\nThere are no traffic lights or other objects reported in the image."
