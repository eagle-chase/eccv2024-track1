The size and load of the truck may impact its ability to maneuver and its speed, which could affect the flow of surrounding traffic and necessitates that we maintain an increased following distance for safety.\n\nAdditionally, there are overhead directional traffic signs with a blue background, displaying routes to Zhengbo Rd., Shihuai Rd., and Liangui Rd. These signs are important as they offer route information that could influence our car's navigational choices depending on the intended destination.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects described in the image, indicating that these elements are not factors in the current driving scenario."

Due to the presence of this construction vehicle on or near the roadway, the ego car's driver must drive cautiously, maintain a safe distance, and be prepared for potential stops or slow-moving traffic. The presence of this type of vehicle often indicates ongoing construction work, which might lead to temporary traffic alterations or obstructions that the driver needs to navigate carefully.",
