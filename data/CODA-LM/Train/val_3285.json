The black car is proceeding straight forward, necessitating the ego car to keep a safe distance behind it to accommodate its movement. On the top-left side of the road, there is a green directional traffic sign indicating an exit ahead. It provides crucial information for the ego car, potentially necessitating a lane change or speed adjustment in anticipation of the exit. Additionally, there are concrete and metal barriers located on the right side of the road, serving as a reminder for the ego car to steer clear of the roadside and stay within the reduced space available for driving. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects identified in the image that impact the ego car's driving behavior."
