It is occupying both the left lane and partially the middle lane, heading in the same direction as the ego car. The truck is visually distinguished by its white and green color and it appears to be moving. Due to its size and lane occupancy, the truck may block the ego car's view of the road ahead and may necessitate the ego car to adjust its speed and navigate with caution.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic light situated directly ahead at the intersection. It is displaying a red signal. This indicates that the ego car is required to come to a stop at the intersection in order to abide by traffic laws and maintain road safety. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects mentioned in the scene."

            "description and explanation": "This is a large construction vehicle, specifically a cement mixer truck. It is designed to transport and mix concrete before it is poured at a construction site. Its large size and heavy weight can affect driving behavior in several ways. Firstly, due to its massive structure, it requires extra space on the road, often resulting in reduced lane width for other vehicles. Secondly, this type of vehicle may move slower than average traffic speed, necessitating that the ego car and others potentially adjust speed or change lanes when safe to do so in order to maintain traffic flow. Lastly, as a construction vehicle, there may be additional stops or reduced speeds as it approaches or departs from construction zones.",

Additionally, maintaining a safe following distance from the cement mixer truck is crucial due to its size and the fact that it occupies multiple lanes. The ego car should monitor the truck's movements closely to respond appropriately to any lane changes or sudden maneuvers."
