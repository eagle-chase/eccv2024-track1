It is positioned slightly to the left side within the lane. The presence and movement of the SUV are critical as they will significantly affect the ego car's decisions regarding speed and overtaking maneuvers.\n\nOn the roadside, there is a yellow diamond-shaped warning sign, representing a caution area ahead. This traffic sign indicates that the driver of the ego car must stay alert for possible unforeseen dangers ahead, which could require prompt reaction.\n\nAdditionally, there is a trash bin located on the sidewalk, close to the curb on the right side of the road. Though the trash bin is not on the roadway itself, it is still considered as it may become a hazard if it were to somehow enter the driving lane.\n\nThere are no other elements such as vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers identified in this traffic image."

It is characterized by a simplistic yet functional design, typically used for transportation or storage of goods. In this particular setup, based on the markers and text, the cart is likely used for municipal services, possibly waste collection. Its presence near the curb influences the driver's awareness; the ego car should monitor such obstacles for any sudden movement or if it affects the trajectory of pedestrians stepping around it, possibly entering the road.",
