However, there are orange and white reflective traffic cones aligned in a line on the right side of the ego vehicle's lane. These cones are indicating a reduction in the available driving space and signal that the vehicle should not cross into the adjacent area due to potential road work, obstacles, or hazards. Furthermore, there are temporary red and white striped barriers situated on the right side of the road, which encircle an unknown hazard or construction zone. These barriers serve as a warning for the ego car to keep to the left and maintain a safe distance from the cordoned-off area to prevent collisions and ensure safe travel.
