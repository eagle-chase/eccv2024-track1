        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are several elements that the ego car must consider. Firstly, there is a blue vehicle traveling ahead in the same lane, which requires the ego car to monitor its speed and braking to maintain a safe following distance. Additionally, a black SUV is parked on the right side of the road; while it does not directly affect the ego car's path, it is important to be vigilant in case the vehicle moves or a door opens unexpectedly. Also on the right, a large light-brown box vehicle is parked, partially blocking the right lane and potentially obscuring the view of hazards, which may necessitate a slight lateral adjustment by the ego car to the left within the lane.\n\nA pedestrian is observed crossing the street in front of the parked black SUV, and their movement must be carefully watched by the ego car to anticipate any need to slow down or stop. On the roadside to the right, a round blue road sign with a white arrow indicates that a mandatory right turn is coming up, informing the ego car's upcoming driving decisions.\n\nLastly, white metal barriers are present along the central median, playing a critical role in keeping the traffic lanes separated and preventing head-on collisions.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the scene that impact the driving behavior of the ego car."
