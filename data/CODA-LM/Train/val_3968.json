The presence of this sedan is critical as it sets the pace for the ego vehicle and could affect decisions regarding lane changes.\n\nAdditionally, there are orange traffic cones on the right side of the ego vehicle, which likely indicate a lane narrowing or a hazardous area ahead. These cones necessitate that the ego vehicle maintains strict lane discipline and possibly reduces speed to navigate the area safely.\n\nFurthermore, a continuous green fence is present along the right side of the road, delineating the boundary of the driving space. This barrier is important as it limits the ability of the ego vehicle to move laterally to the right, ensuring that it stays within the designated road lanes.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects reported in this traffic image that impact the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."
