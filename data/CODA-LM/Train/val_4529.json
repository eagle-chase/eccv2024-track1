This vehicle is significant because its extended arm could pose a risk due to possible sway or sudden turns.

Due to its presence on the road, the ego car needs to ensure a safe distance is maintained. Additionally, the ego car might need to reduce speed or change lanes to navigate safely around this obstacle, especially if the vehicle is moving slowly or stationary, which is common for such vehicles during work in progress areas.",

Adjust speed as necessary to react safely to potential hazards."
