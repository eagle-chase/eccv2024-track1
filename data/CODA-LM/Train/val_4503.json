Firstly, there is a large construction vehicle, possibly a mobile crane or concrete pump with an extended boom, occupying the center lane directly in front of the ego car. The size and position of this construction vehicle require the ego car to maintain a safe following distance or to consider changing lanes to avoid any potential hazards.\n\nAdditionally, a white sedan is present in the left lane, overtaking the ego car. This indicates that the left lane is in use, which may limit the ego car's ability to safely change lanes to that side.\n\nOn the right lane, there is a red city bus, positioned parallel to the construction vehicle, with its rear facing the ego car. The bus's potential to make stops could affect the flow of traffic, and the ego car must be prepared for any sudden stops or turns the bus may execute.\n\nAbove the construction vehicle, there is a green traffic light, which indicates that the vehicles in front, including the construction vehicle and the bus, have the right of way to proceed. The ego car should be ready to move forward in response to the green light, taking into account the positions and actions of the vehicles ahead."
