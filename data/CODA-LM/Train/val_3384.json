        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are two vehicles that require attention. A large blue truck with a crane attachment is located in the left adjacent lane, just a bit ahead of the ego car. This truck's considerable size and its current position could potentially obstruct the ego car's view of the road ahead and may affect traffic flow, as it might change lanes or decelerate unexpectedly. Additionally, a green sedan is in the right lane, running parallel and slightly ahead of the ego car, which limits the ego car's options for rightward lane changes or other maneuvers. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image, so these do not impact the driving decisions for the ego car."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, specifically a mobile crane mounted on a truck base. The crane is prominent due to its large, yellow telescopic arm, which is extended upward and configured for heavy lifting operations. The vehicles body is blue, and it is equipped with rear lights and safety markers to enhance visibility. Such construction vehicles often move slowly and make sudden stops or turns to maneuver or position for work around construction sites. When driving near this construction vehicle, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance, anticipate possible sudden movements from the vehicle, and be prepared for temporary traffic disruptions caused by construction operations. Observing these precautions can help prevent accidents and ensure smooth traffic flow.",

Additionally, the ego car should be cautious about changing to the right lane, ensuring the green sedan is at a safe distance to avoid any potential collision."
