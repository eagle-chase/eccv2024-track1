Red and white portable barriers are located on the right side of the road, partially surrounding the parked truck, indicating a temporary change in traffic patterns or a protective measure, leading to a narrower road and the need for navigational adjustments.\n\nLastly, there is a light source casting glare towards the camera, which could be from another vehicle's headlight, making it difficult to see parts of the scene clearly. This glare can impair the driver's vision, affecting their decision-making and reaction time."
