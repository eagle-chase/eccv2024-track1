        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, a red truck is situated on the road to the right. Its position, parallel to the roadway and at a distance, suggests it may be parked or stationary. This truck may indicate ongoing construction or transport activities and could partly obstruct the roadway or signal the presence of nearby workers, warranting increased attentiveness and caution.\n\nSeveral construction workers are present to the right side of the road. They are dressed in high-visibility clothing and are either standing or engaged in manual labor. Their proximity to the traffic lane makes them particularly vulnerable and necessitates that the autonomous vehicle reduces its speed, remains vigilant, and is ready to halt to ensure the safety of these workers.\n\nAhead in the scene is a traffic light displaying a green signal, allowing the autonomous vehicle to continue through the intersection. While the green light confirms that proceeding is currently safe, the autonomous vehicle must remain alert due to the construction area and the possibility of workers or vehicles unexpectedly entering the driving path.\n\nOrange traffic cones have been set up along the edge of the roadworks zone, intruding slightly onto the road to delineate the work area. These cones serve as a guide for the autonomous vehicle to shift leftward, ensuring that it stays clear of the work area and maintains a safe distance from the construction efforts and workers."
