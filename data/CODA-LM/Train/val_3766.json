This bus is noted to affect the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle due to its considerable size and the possibility of it executing unexpected maneuvers such as stops or turns.\n\nDirectly ahead of the ego car, there is a motorcyclist positioned in the center of the road, proceeding towards an intersection. Given that motorcyclists are more exposed due to their vehicle's smaller size and lack of a protective frame, it is crucial for the ego car to maintain an adequate following distance and remain prepared for any abrupt adjustments in the motorcyclist's speed or trajectory.\n\nAt the intersection towards which the ego car is heading, traffic lights are visible and currently display a green signal. While the green light permits the car to continue its course, continued alertness is required to adapt to the changing traffic conditions and possible signal transitions at the junction.\n\nTo the right of the image, several motorcycles are parked on the sidewalk adjacent to buildings. These parked motorcycles do not immediately alter the route of the ego car, but they represent potential risks if any riders decide to join the traffic flow without warning."
