The truck's large size and load affect its braking distance and maneuverability, posing risks for sudden stops or lane shifts.\n\nSecondly, a white car is visible on the left side of the image in the lane adjacent to the ego car. This car is traveling parallel to the ego car, and its close proximity could lead to potential lane merging or overtaking scenarios.\n\nLastly, there is a smaller truck with a red advertisement on the right side, moving in the same direction as the ego car but in a different lane. This truck's presence is significant in case it decides to merge or change lanes."

            "description and explanation": "This is a construction vehicle equipped with machinery likely used for road or building work. The vehicle is a heavy-duty truck characterized by its robust structure and visible cargo of construction equipment. In the driving scenario, the presence of this vehicle signifies possible nearby construction sites. Therefore, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential slowdowns or lane shifts due to construction-related activities or obstacles. It is important for the driver to stay alert for sudden moves from such vehicles, as they often perform unexpected maneuvers or stoppages.",

Consider potential hazards from both the truck and the adjacent white car which might merge or change speed abruptly. Being cautious and ready to brake or adjust the lane position if the truck or any other vehicle behaves unpredictably would be advisable."
