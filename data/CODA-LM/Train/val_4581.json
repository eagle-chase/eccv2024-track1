        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scene, there are two road users identified. Firstly, there is a large white cement mixer truck positioned in the right lane directly ahead of the ego vehicle. The size and placement of the mixer truck are causing a partial obstruction of the view, which could make it challenging for the ego car to safely maneuver or change lanes due to the restricted visibility and available space. Additionally, the truck's behavior could be unpredictable, including potential slowing or unexpected stops, which necessitates careful attention from the ego car's operating system.\n\nSecondly, there is a police car located on the left side, ahead of the cement mixer truck. The police car's rooftop lights are activated, signaling that there might be an incident or a law enforcement action taking place up ahead. This indicates a possible disruption in the traffic flow, such as sudden stops, lane closures, or directions being given by traffic officers, which the ego car will need to anticipate and respond to appropriately. This element adds to the complexity of the driving environment and requires the autonomous system to be prepared for a range of possible scenarios that could impact driving behavior."

            "description and explanation": "This image shows a construction vehicle, specifically a cement mixer, characterized by its large rotating drum used for mixing cement components. The presence of this type of vehicle on the road generally suggests nearby construction activity. For the ego vehicle, this means an increased likelihood of encountering temporary traffic restrictions, slow-moving vehicles, and possibly debris on the road. As a response, the driver of the ego vehicle should remain vigilant, maintain a safe following distance, and be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if required for safety and to accommodate the flow of traffic around the construction vehicle.",

Additionally, the ego car should prepare to react to potential instructions or changes in traffic flow caused by the police car ahead. The driver should stay alert for any other road users that might be obscured by the large vehicles and be ready to slow down or stop if necessary. No lane changes should be made unless the adjacent lanes are confirmed to be clear and safe to enter."
