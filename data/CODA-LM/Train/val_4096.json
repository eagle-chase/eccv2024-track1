However, there are other objects of interest that impact the driving behavior of the ego car. \n\nFirstly, there are large industrial cable reels located on the left side of the road, adjacent to the perimeter wall. These objects are noteworthy due to their close proximity to the roadway. Although they are stationary and do not directly block the road, their presence could influence the decisions of the ego car. This is especially true if there is moving equipment or personnel involved in handling these objects, which is not currently visible but could potentially emerge.\n\nSecondly, there are two pedestrians on the right side, walking away from the ego vehicle. These individuals are near the road but not on it, posing no immediate danger. However, their closeness to the roadway requires ongoing observation in case they decide to cross or approach the road, which could present a hazard."

In this scenario, the object being on the side of the road does not directly influence the driving behavior of the ego car if it remains stationary and secured. However, it is essential for the driver to be aware of such objects near roadways as they could pose potential hazards if not properly secured or if they somehow move onto the roadway.",
