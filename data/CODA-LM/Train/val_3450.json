Directly in front of the ego car, there is a silver van with its brake lights on, indicating that it is either stopping or slowing down. The ego car should be prepared to stop or slow down accordingly. Additionally, there is a red truck on the left ahead, which also appears to be slowing down or stopping, as evidenced by its brake lights. This suggests that there may be traffic congestion ahead, and the ego car should be ready to slow down. On the right, slightly ahead of the ego car, is a small red vehicle that could be merging or in the ego car's blind spot, necessitating extra caution from the ego car when changing lanes or adjusting its position.\n\nAlthough the traffic light ahead is green, granting the right of way, the ego car must proceed with caution due to the possibility of the light changing soon and the presence of stopped traffic ahead.\n\nOn the left side of the road, there are orange traffic cones arranged in a line that narrows the driving lane, indicating a construction zone or road hazard. This requires vehicles to merge to the right and reduce speed.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene."
