            "description and explanation": "The object identified here is a cyclist observed at night. The cyclist is riding on what appears to be an electric bicycle, as evidenced by the design of the bike, particularly the frame and rear wheel area which seems to house a battery. The presence of this cyclist in the scenario significantly impacts the driving behavior of the ego vehicle. The driver must maintain a careful watch and practice cautious driving, ensuring sufficient space is given while overtaking the cyclist to avoid any potential accidents. This responsibility is increased during nighttime driving due to reduced visibility and the need for heightened awareness of smaller, less illuminated road users like cyclists.",

Keeping a careful watch on the cyclist and maintaining a safe distance are key to preventing accidents and ensuring both the motorist's and the cyclist's safety.",

The environment suggests the necessity for heightened awareness and readiness for responsive action."
