Its significant size and the confined space available for maneuvering pose a risk of obstructing part of the road or engaging in unpredictable movements that could impact the flow of traffic. Additionally, there is a tall roadside banner on the right, likely displaying information about distances to various locations or attractions in Chinese. While this banner doesnâ€™t have a direct impact on immediate driving decisions, it does offer navigational guidance and enhances situational awareness for drivers."

Its presence suggests that there may be ongoing construction or roadwork in the area. For the ego car, seeing this vehicle indicates the need to be cautious, possibly reducing speed and being prepared for unexpected obstructions or changes in road conditions. It might also suggest that there could be workers near the road, thus increasing the importance of vigilant driving to ensure safety.",
