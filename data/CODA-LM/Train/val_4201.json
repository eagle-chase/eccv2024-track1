This truck may be either moving or parked on the edge of the lane, which potentially narrows the usable road width for the ego car and influences its navigational decisions. Additionally, multiple red taillights from vehicles ahead on the right indicate either slow-moving or stationary traffic, directly affecting the ego car's speed and possibly its lane choice while necessitating safe following distances. Furthermore, orange traffic cones are placed in a row along the right side of the driving lane, signaling likely road work or lane closures. These cones are essential for indicating that the ego vehicle may need to change lanes or reduce speed to navigate the area safely."

The wet road conditions suggest an increased stopping distance, therefore, maintaining a larger than usual gap to the vehicle ahead is advisable. Lane changes may be necessary, and should be done with heightened alertness and indication due to the reduced lane width and visibility conditions."
