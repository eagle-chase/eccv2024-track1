Although the forklift is not directly on the road, it could still pose a potential hazard if it unexpectedly moves onto the road or if its load affects the conditions of the road. Additionally, there is a pedestrian walking on the sidewalk to the right, moving away from the ego car. This pedestrian is not currently on the road; however, they should be monitored as they may step onto the road unexpectedly, or if the nearby forklift creates an unsafe situation. There are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that affect driving behavior."
