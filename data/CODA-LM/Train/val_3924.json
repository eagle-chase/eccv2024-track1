One of the trucks is positioned at the center of the intersection and has visible safety lighting. These trucks may be stationary due to construction work or preparing to move. Their presence might block visual and physical paths, affecting traffic flow and the ego vehicle's ability to pass or turn safely at the intersection.

This red light instructs vehicles, including the ego car, to stop and not proceed through the intersection, which is crucial for avoiding collisions and obeying traffic laws."

Such vehicles are commonly used in construction zones to transport heavy materials or machinery. The presence of this vehicle suggests current or recent roadwork in the area. For the ego car, this information is critical as it implies potential disruptions in regular traffic flow, such as closed lanes, reduced speed limits, or detours. The ego car must approach the area with increased caution and readiness to adjust speed or route in response to construction zone conditions.",
