This sedan's proximity and direction could influence the ego car's decisions regarding lane changes or speed maintenance. The second vehicle is an orange construction vehicle parked on the left side of the road, which is stationary and not in the direct path of the ego car. However, its presence suggests potential road work ahead. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the image."
