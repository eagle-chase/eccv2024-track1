        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are two notable vehicles. Firstly, a large red firetruck is positioned on the left side of the image, partially blocking the lane. It is marked with the word 'NOLITON' and has reflective striping. This firetruck affects driving behavior as it occupies a significant portion of the driving lane, requiring the ego car to adjust its driving path. Additionally, its active emergency lights indicate an ongoing response situation. Secondly, a white SUV is observed in the right lane ahead of the ego car, with its brake lights illuminated, suggesting it is either slowing down or stopped. This action hints at possible traffic congestion or an obstruction ahead, necessitating the ego car to reduce speed and increase following distance accordingly. No other relevant road users or objects are present in the image."

Recognizable by its large structure and reflective striping, it is often equipped with tools such as barriers and lights to secure construction zones. Its presence might indicate ongoing construction or road maintenance activities ahead, necessitating caution and potentially slower speeds from the ego car. The future driving behavior should involve awareness of possible lane restrictions or the presence of workers and machinery on the road.",

Due to their size and reduced maneuverability, they influence driving behavior by necessitating increased following distance and extra caution during overtaking maneuvers. The ego car should remain alert for sudden stops or changes in the truck's speed, especially in traffic or construction areas.",
