However, there are orange traffic cones placed on the right side of the road in the rightmost lane, suggesting an active construction or maintenance area. This implies a reduction in the number of available lanes and points to a possible need for the ego car to change lanes to avoid the maintenance area. Additionally, there's a group of workers wearing reflective vests engaged in road or infrastructure work also on the right. These workers call for increased attentiveness and the potential need for the ego car to adjust its driving in response to unforeseen changes or movements near the worksite. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or barriers present in the image, which reduces the complexity of the driving situation for the ego car."

It is designed to be highly visible with alternating colors (often orange and white) to ensure it draws attention. In the context of this image, the traffic cone indicates that there may be hazardous conditions ahead, such as road work or lane closures. It influences driving behavior by signaling to the driver of the ego car to reduce speed and potentially prepare to change lanes to avoid the designated area marked by the cone.",
