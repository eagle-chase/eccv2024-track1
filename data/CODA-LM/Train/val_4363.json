The vehicles present include a large orange excavator on a flatbed truck parked on the right side of the road, impacting road navigation by partially obstructing the lane. Right behind this truck, a white sedan is parked, further reducing the drivable road width and adding to the navigational challenges. Additionally, a line of heavy construction machinery, including various excavation equipment and their transport trucks, indicates potential construction work ahead, which may result in slowed or redirected traffic. A white van is also parked in front of the heavy machinery on the right side, close to the flow of traffic, presenting an obstacle that might suddenly be moved or accessed by its occupants. Furthermore, a black sedan is driving in the opposite lane towards the camera, which requires the ego car to maintain safe lane discipline and be prepared for possible erratic maneuvers from the oncoming traffic.\n\nA blue traffic sign marked 'P5' is located on the right side above the white vans, indicating a designated parking area which suggests potential activity or frequent vehicle movement in that zone.\n\nAdditionally, temporary construction barriers are visible on the right side, possibly around the parked construction machinery, indicating sections of the road that are either closed or have restricted access, necessitating the ego car to adjust its path accordingly."
