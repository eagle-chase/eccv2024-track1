These cones guide the ego car to avoid areas that could be dangerous.\n\nLarge red barriers are positioned on the right-hand side of the intersection, surrounding a construction site, suggesting limited available road space and potential navigational obstacles.\n\nThe 'other objects' category had no items listed, which means there were no additional items in the image that could impact the driving situation."
