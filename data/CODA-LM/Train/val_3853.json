        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are several elements that require careful attention. A yellow construction vehicle is located on the right side of the road, its orientation is diagonal, and it's partially occupying the road. It has an operational arm that might extend into the path of the ego vehicle, indicating that if it starts moving or continues its operation, it could potentially disrupt the road space and cause a hazard to the ego car.\n\nAdditionally, there's a light brown or beige flatbed truck on the left side of the road, faced away from the ego vehicle, and parked by the curbside. While the truck is stationary and does not present an immediate threat, it is crucial to remain aware of its presence in case it begins to move.\n\nOn the right, close to the construction vehicle and behind traffic cones, there is a pedestrian. The pedestrian seems to be either watching the construction work or waiting to cross the road. Given their proximity to the construction site and their unpredictable behavior, they might step onto the road, prompting the ego vehicle to exercise caution.\n\nThe traffic scene also includes traffic cones. These orange and white cones are placed in front of the construction area on the right side of the road, signaling a closed or restricted lane that the ego vehicle must navigate around, due to the ongoing construction.\n\nIn addition to the cones, there are blue and white temporary fencing barriers encircling the construction site on the right. These barriers serve as a reminder of the ongoing construction and its associated dangers. They also constrict the roadway and restrict access to the site, thus impacting the potential routes for the ego car.\n\nFinally, there is an electronic red scrolling text sign located above a gate on the right side of the road. Although the sign is not a traffic light, it may display crucial information or warnings for drivers in Chinese text, which should not be ignored.\n\nNo traffic signs or other objects are present in the scene that would affect the ego vehicle's driving decisions."
