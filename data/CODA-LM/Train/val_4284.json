        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are two notable vulnerable road users. The first is an unattended dog located in the middle of the road, which is cause for concern. Since the dog is without a leash or collar, it could potentially make sudden movements. As a result, the autonomous car should be prepared to execute emergency braking or make a swift evasive maneuver, which could disrupt the flow of traffic and increase the possibility of a collision.\n\nThe second vulnerable road user is a cyclist positioned on the right side of the road. The cyclist, dressed in casual clothes and riding a standard bicycle, may make unpredictable movements such as swerving or changing lanes without much warning. Therefore, any vehicle, including the autonomous car, must overtake the cyclist with extreme caution and maintain a safe distance as required by traffic regulations to ensure safety for all parties involved. \n\nNo other categories such as vehicles, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in the image."

The driver of the ego car should reduce speed and be prepared to stop or maneuver carefully to avoid a collision, ensuring the safety of both the animal and vehicle occupants.",

Prepare to adjust vehicle control based on assessment of actual movements of the road users mentioned."
