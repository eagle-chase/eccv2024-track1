        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are a couple of notable vehicles. Firstly, there's a large cement mixer truck positioned on the right side of the road. It is notable for overlapping into the right lane while also being on the shoulder, which could restrict the available space for the ego vehicle to safely maneuver next to it. Secondly, there is a compact sedan that is located ahead of the ego vehicle in the left lane, traveling in the same direction. The sedan's presence is significant because it may affect the ego car's ability to overtake or to change lanes. No other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, cones, barriers, or other objects are mentioned, indicating they do not impact the driving scenario being described."

Given its size and the type of cargo it carries, this vehicle typically moves slower compared to regular traffic. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential sudden stops or reduced speed due to the operation of this vehicle.",
