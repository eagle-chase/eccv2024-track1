Firstly, a line of orange traffic cones is observed on the right side of the road, resulting in a road divergence. The placement of these cones suggests that the right lane is partially closed or obstructed, necessitating a change in lane or a decrease in speed for the safety of all road users. \n\nAdditionally, yellow and red barriers are visible on the far right side of the image. These barriers likely signify ongoing construction or demarcate no-access zones, serving as a tool to manage traffic flow and prevent vehicles from entering potentially dangerous or restricted areas.\n\nLastly, there are multiple large billboards and informational signs situated on the right side of the road. While they seem to offer directions or advertisements to passersby, they generally do not influence driving behavior significantly, unless they happen to conceal important traffic signs or signals.\n\nThe image is devoid of vehicles, vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists, traffic signs, and traffic lights that could otherwise influence immediate driving decisions."
