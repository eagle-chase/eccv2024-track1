Ahead of the ego car, there is a large orange construction vehicle occupying most of the driving lane. This vehicle is moving slowly and may stop or turn unpredictably due to the nature of its work. To the left of the ego car, a motorcyclist is positioned near the construction vehicle. Motorcyclists are less visible and more vulnerable, requiring additional attention and caution from the ego car.\n\nOn the sidewalk to the right of the ego car, there are pedestrians. One pedestrian is near the edge of the sidewalk and might enter the road, which poses a risk that must be closely monitored as pedestrians can be unpredictable.\n\nAdditionally, orange traffic cones are positioned on the right side, creating a barrier between the road and the sidewalk, indicating a construction zone or a detour. These traffic cones direct traffic away from potential hazards associated with the construction works and reduce the available driving lane width."

It is used in construction and roadworks, often for tasks such as lifting, loading, or excavation. The presence of such a vehicle on the road typically indicates ongoing construction work nearby. For the ego car, this implies the need for increased awareness and potentially reduced speed to navigate safely around the area, considering possible obstacles or personnel working near the roadway.",

Additionally, be prepared to stop or yield to the pedestrians if they approach the roadway. Overtaking the construction vehicle may not be safe due to the reduced lane width and closeness of the pedestrians and traffic cones. Ensure that the motorcyclist is given enough space and avoid any sudden lane changes that could create a risk for them."
