This requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be ready to stop if necessary. Alongside the road, there are multiple construction workers wearing high-visibility clothing within a clearly marked construction zone to the right. The proximity of the workers to the driving lane necessitates that the ego car proceed with extra caution and at a slower speed to ensure their safety.\n\nAlthough there are no traffic signs in the immediate vicinity that demand the ego car's attention, the scene does include orange and white traffic cones placed along the right edge of the driving lane. These cones indicate that the drivable road space is reduced due to construction, signaling the ego car to stay within the modified driving lane and to be vigilant for potential obstacles or changes in the road's width. Additionally, temporary concrete barriers are present on the right, demarcating the boundary of the construction area. These barriers serve to restrict access to certain areas and guide the ego car to remain within the designated safe travel lane, away from the construction activities.\n\nThere are no traffic lights visible in the current frame, which means the ego car does not have to comply with any signal-specific instructions at this moment. Furthermore, there are no other objects detected in the scene that could be categorized as affecting the driving behavior of the ego car."
