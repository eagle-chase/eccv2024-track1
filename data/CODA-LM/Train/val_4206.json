Positioned at an intersection or a relevant traffic point, this traffic light directs the movement of vehicles. The green light indicates that vehicles facing the light can proceed, which has the immediate influence of allowing the ego car to continue moving forward without stopping, thereby potentially influencing the future flow of traffic by maintaining the movement without interruption. This allows for the coordination and management of vehicle movements at intersections, promoting safe and efficient traffic flows.",
