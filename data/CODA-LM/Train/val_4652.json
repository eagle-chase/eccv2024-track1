It is slightly angled towards the road, which suggests that the vehicle could potentially merge into the lane of the ego car or there might be a chance of doors opening that could obstruct the path. Further down on the same side, a blue car is also parked behind the gray van. Although it is stationary, it necessitates vigilance in case it starts moving abruptly or if passengers start to disembark.\n\nAdditionally, there is a bicycle with a cargo trailer attached, which is also parked on the right side of the road. The position of this bicycle indicates a potential obstruction and there is a risk of it moving suddenly, representing a possible danger to the ego car.\n\nTo the left of the road are large vertical signs mounted on a pole, displaying advertisements and possibly some informational content. While the explicit content of these signs does not seem pertinent to driving decisions, they signal commercial activity or local information and hence, contribute to environmental awareness.\n\nLastly, a red dustbin is present on the roadside to the left, situated beside the pedestrian pathway. The dustbin is stationary and not an immediate threat to the vehicle’s path; however, it should be considered that it could impact pedestrians’ behavior or be inadvertently moved in a way that could affect traffic flow."

The tricycle is parked on the side of the road near the sidewalk, which is a common practice for vehicles when not in use.
