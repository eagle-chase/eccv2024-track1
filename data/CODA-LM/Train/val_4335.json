The truck has its signaling arrows and hazard lights active. The presence of the signaling arrows on the truck suggests that there may be lane closures or other cautions ahead. This requires the ego car to pay close attention and be prepared to make necessary lane changes for safety. No other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in the image."

The presence of such a vehicle on the road usually indicates nearby construction activity. This might necessitate increased awareness and caution from the driver of the ego vehicle, as construction zones typically have altered traffic patterns and possibly reduced speed limits to ensure safety around the site.",

Prepare to reduce speed or change lanes if necessary, obeying any navigational cues given by the truck's signaling system. Continuous monitoring of the truck's indicators will guide whether maintaining the current lane or switching to another becomes necessary."
