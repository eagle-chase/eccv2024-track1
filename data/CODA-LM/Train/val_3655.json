A large cement mixer truck is directly ahead in the center lane, traveling at a similar speed to the surrounding traffic. Due to its size and potential to obstruct the view, caution and increased following distance are necessary.\n2. A white car is in the left lane, slightly ahead of the cement mixer truck, and possibly within the truck's blind spot. This situation necessitates the ego car to be prepared for potential lane changes or sudden braking.\n3. Several cars are visible in the right lane, traveling in the same direction at varying distances from the ego car. The behavior of these vehicles may influence the ego car's ability to change lanes or adjust speed.\n\nThere is also one notable traffic sign:\n- A speed limit sign is visible on the right side of the road, indicating the legal speed limit for this section. This informs the ego car of the maximum speed it should be traveling under current road conditions.\n\nAdditionally, a barrier is present:\n- A physical median barrier is seen between the opposing lanes of traffic. This barrier separates the flow of traffic and prevents vehicles from crossing into oncoming lanes, affecting the ego car's ability to make any leftward movements."

The ego car should not attempt any leftward movements across the median barrier and should continue in its current lane unless a safe opportunity to change lanes presents itself."
