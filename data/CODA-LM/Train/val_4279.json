Ahead, there is a white van obstructing the view of the road, which might require sudden braking if it decelerates or halts unexpectedly. The presence of multiple sedans and passenger cars, including a silver sedan on the left, contributes to the overall congestion. Care is needed to monitor these vehicles' actions, as they may perform sudden lane shifts or other maneuvers.\n\nMoreover, there are traffic lights ahead displaying a red signal, necessitating a complete stop at the intersection. Consequently, the ego vehicle's stopping distance and the waiting period are affected by the traffic light's current status.\n\nOn the right side of the road, orange traffic cones suggest either ongoing road works or a lane closure. These cones dictate that the ego vehicle should maintain a path to the left, steering clear of any potential dangers or prohibited zones.\n\nAdditionally, lining the roadside to the right are temporary fences, which likely mark construction sites or pedestrian areas, signaling the advisability of decreasing speed and heightening the driver's alertness.\n\nNone of the categories for vulnerable road users, traffic signs, or other objects contain relevant data in this particular image, indicating they are not factors influencing the current driving scenario."
