The presence of this black sedan directly affects the ego vehicle's ability to safely change lanes or adjust its speed to maintain an appropriate distance, ensuring safety.\n\nAdditionally, there is a blue sedan located further ahead in the same left lane. Although at a distance, this vehicle has the potential to influence the driving behavior of the ego vehicle. The ego vehicle must remain alert to any sudden maneuvers, such as braking or turning, executed by the blue sedan to take preemptive actions and avoid any possible hazards.\n\nNo other road users, including vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects, were identified in the observed traffic scene."

Traffic cones are typically used to alert drivers to potential hazards ahead, such as road construction, obstructions, or changes in traffic patterns. They serve as temporary markers that guide drivers to navigate away from the potential danger area. In the future driving scenario, the presence of this traffic cone indicates a likelihood that the ego car should reduce speed and proceed with heightened caution, possibly preparing to change lanes if the road ahead is obstructed.",
