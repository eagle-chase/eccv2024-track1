The vehicle is equipped with a large mixing drum which is commonly used for mixing concrete. Such a vehicle on the road indicates that there might be a construction site nearby. For the ego car, this means extra caution is necessary. The presence of this vehicle might lead to potential delays, increased traffic, or temporary lane closures. Hence, the driver of the ego car should remain alert for any sudden stops or slow-moving traffic ahead due to this construction vehicle.",
