The van's location partially blocks the rightmost lane, which has an impact on driving behavior by requiring other vehicles to move into the left lane to pass. This could potentially reduce traffic flow as the roadway width available for vehicles is decreased.\n\nAdditionally, a line of orange traffic cones is set up, directing the traffic away from the problematic right lane. The presence of these cones also influences driving behavior by indicating that there may be roadwork ahead or another type of obstruction. As a result, vehicles are obliged to change lanes to the left, which ensures a clear path around whatever issue may be present in the right lane."
