Firstly, a white car is traveling in the opposite direction on the same road as the ego car, which could influence the ego car's decision-making, particularly when considering overtaking or lane adjustments. Additionally, there are several parked cars along the side of the road, with some encroaching onto the driving lane. These parked cars could hide pedestrians or other hazards from the ego car's view, requiring the driver to be extra cautious and vigilant for any unexpected obstacles.\n\nOn the roadside, there is an adult male seated next to a bicycle. This situation poses a risk as the individual may decide to enter the road, either by walking with the bike or by cycling, which could affect the traffic flow and the ego car's driving strategy.\n\nLastly, there is debris and various objects scattered around the roadside and near the pedestrian area. These objects could become dangerous if they were to be moved onto the road by external factors or by the person with the bicycle, creating potential hazards for the ego car to navigate.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image that need to be accounted for in this scenario."
