        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, there are two road users categorized as vehicles. The first is a yellow crane, located on the right side of the road and currently in operation. The activity of the crane poses a potential obstruction and could result in unpredictable movements, affecting the traffic flow and requiring drivers to proceed with caution. The second vehicle present is a police car that is parked near the crane, also on the right side of the road. The presence of the police car likely indicates an ongoing operation or an emergency situation, which may constrict the roadway for other users and would advise a reduction in speed when passing by. No other road users or objects, such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects, are reported in this scene."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a large mobile crane, located on the side of the street, marked by its long, extendable boom. This equipment is typically used for heavy lifting and is a part of road or building construction activities. Its position and the activities it's involved in can influence traffic conditions. For the ego vehicle, this may mean potential adjustments in lane usage, reduced lane width, or temporary halts due to construction operation. These factors require the driver to reduce speed and enhance vigilance for safety around such heavy machinery.",

Given the wet road conditions, the ego car should also adjust speed to ensure safety and control over potentially slippery surfaces."
