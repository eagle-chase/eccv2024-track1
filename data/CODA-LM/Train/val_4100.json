        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, the road is shared by a large cement mixer truck and several passenger cars. The cement mixer truck is located directly in front of the autonomous vehicle, taking up the central portion of the driving lane. It is a heavy vehicle, and its rotating drum suggests that it's operational. This implies that the mixer truck may stop or slow down abruptly, requiring the autonomous vehicle to maintain a safe following distance.\n\nTo the left of the mixer truck, in an adjacent lane, there are multiple cars driving in parallel at various distances. The variability in their positions adds complexity to the driving environment, as the autonomous vehicle must stay aware of these vehicles' potential lane changes or speed adjustments to prevent merging conflicts.\n\nAdditionally, the traffic flow is regulated by traffic lights. There is a traffic light ahead, presenting a red signal and stationed over the intersection past the mixer truck. The red signal means that the autonomous vehicle will have to decelerate and prepare to stop at the intersection.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians or cyclists, are present in this image; neither are there any traffic cones, barriers, or other objects that would impact the autonomous vehicle's driving decisions."

Buses typically make frequent stops and may pull over at dedicated bus stops. Drivers of the ego car should be vigilant for sudden stops or when the bus is merging back into traffic after a stop. Giving way to the bus as it leaves a bus stop can be expected, adhering to local traffic rules that may give priority to buses.

For the ego car, it is important to maintain a safe distance as sudden stops can occur and there may be debris around such vehicles. Additionally, these trucks often have larger blind spots, and their larger turning radius requires other drivers to provide extra space when these vehicles are making turns.",
