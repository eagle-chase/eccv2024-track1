The presence of the parked car decreases the available width of the road, compelling vehicles to maneuver carefully and reduce their speed. Secondly, there are multiple reflective traffic cones arranged in a row on the right side of the road, which narrow the lane. These traffic cones indicate a possible road narrowing or hazard, advising the ego car to slow down and potentially merge to the left. These elements are critical for ensuring safe navigation through the area."
