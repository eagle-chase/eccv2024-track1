Since this SUV may change speed or lanes, it requires attention, as it may impact the traffic flow and decision-making for the ego vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, a speed limit sign indicating a maximum limit of 30 is mounted on the guardrail to the right of the road. This is essential for the ego vehicle to observe traffic regulations and ensure a safe journey.\n\nA green traffic light is also observed above the cement mixer truck on the left, signaling that the road users in this part of the road have the right to continue, which is important information for the ego car as it decides to move forward.\n\nLastly, guardrails are installed along the right-hand side of the road, creating a boundary for the driving lanes and enhancing road safety by preventing vehicles from leaving the roadway.\n\nIt's worth noting there are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, or other miscellaneous objects in the scene that impact the ego vehicle's driving behavior."
