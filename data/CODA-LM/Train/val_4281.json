These cones are orange with reflective white bands and are arranged in a line across the right side of a multi-lane road. Their presence suggests an upcoming lane closure or roadwork, implying that vehicles, including the ego car, will need to change lanes to avoid the blocked area. There are no vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects reported in this specific scene."

It is generally slower compared to motorized vehicles and used often for transport of goods or as a personal transportation device in less congested areas. The presence of a tricycle on the road necessitates cautious driving from the ego car, ensuring safe passing distance and reduced speed to safely overtake without causing any risk to the tricycle rider.",
