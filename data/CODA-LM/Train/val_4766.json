This truck's size and load could pose a potential hazard if the equipment is not securely fastened, and it may limit visibility and maneuverability for the ego vehicle. Additionally, multiple cars are visible in front of the ego vehicle, traveling in the same direction, which will dictate the travel speed and necessitate readiness for sudden braking or maneuvering. Ahead, a traffic light shows green, indicating that the traffic in the direction of the ego vehicle has the right of way and can proceed."

Due to its size and the extended load it is carrying, the driver of the ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be cautious. Such vehicles may make sudden stops or slow maneuvers, and the extended load can affect their turning radius, posing challenges to nearby vehicles.",
