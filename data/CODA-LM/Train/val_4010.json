        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a large truck with a canvas-covered cargo area that is positioned directly adjacent to the ego car. The presence of this truck is significant as its close proximity and size may obstruct the view for the driver of the ego car. This can make it difficult to spot other vehicles, road users, or signs that might be on the side where the truck is located. Additionally, the truck's size and position limit the maneuverability of the ego car, posing a challenge if the driver needs to change lanes or make turns."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a large, covered wheel of a heavy truck, visible partially beneath a tarp-covered structure, likely part of the trailer's load carry. The exposed part of the wheel and its relative size suggest it is designed to support heavy weights, typical of large transport vehicles used in goods distribution. For the ego car, maintaining a safe following distance is crucial, especially considering the size and braking capabilities of large trucks. It helps in avoiding collisions in case the truck stops abruptly or loses part of its load.",

It should also consider changing lanes if it is safe to do so, only after ensuring no other road users are obstructed by the truck's presence or any other obscured road users are in the vicinity."
