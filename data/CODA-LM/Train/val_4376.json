It is a large, heavy truck equipped with a rotating drum used to mix cement components. The presence of this vehicle on the road influences the driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating cautious and slower driving. Due to its size and the nature of its load, it might make sudden stops or slow movements. The ego car must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential hazards such as spills from the mixer or debris around the construction area.",
