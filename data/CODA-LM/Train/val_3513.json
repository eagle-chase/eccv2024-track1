This vehicle requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance to react to any sudden changes. Additionally, there are cars in the adjacent left lane moving at varying speeds, which could affect the lane change decisions or merging patterns of the ego car.

It should prepare to maneuver around the debris on the road when it is safe to do so, checking for adjacent traffic. The green traffic light allows the ego car to keep moving, but it should remain alert for other vehicles that may unexpectedly enter the intersection. No immediate action needed in response to the left lane cars, but monitoring their movements in case of lane changes would be advisable."
