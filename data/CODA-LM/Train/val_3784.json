It is an obstruction as it partially blocks the traffic lane with its arm and bucket extended into the air. Its presence requires the ego car to be cautious and consider a lane change if it is safe to do so.\n\nAdditionally, there is a yellow and black circular warning sign located on the excavator, which indicates that construction operations are underway. This sign serves as an alert to drivers about the potential hazards and the possibility of abnormal traffic patterns due to the construction activities.\n\nFurthermore, there are traffic cones and barrier boards in proximity to the excavator. A traffic cone, situated to the left of the excavator, along with the barrier boards, delineates the construction site boundaries. These tools are used for guiding traffic safely around the obstacles and could denote that part of the road or lane is closed off.\n\nLastly, barrier boards with reflective stripes are surrounding the site. These boards act as visual guides to direct vehicles around the construction area, clearly delineating where vehicles are not supposed to go to ensure safety."
