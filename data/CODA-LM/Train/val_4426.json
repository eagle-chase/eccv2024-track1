        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there is a car covered by a colorful tarp parked on the left side of the road. This is in addition to multiple vehicles parked on both sides of a narrow street. The presence of these parked vehicles significantly reduces the width of the road that can be used for driving. As a result, any vehicle making its way through will need to maneuver carefully to ensure safe passage. This involves avoiding contact with the parked cars while also not straying too far into the opposite lane, which can pose risks of a head-on collision.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists present in the scene. Additionally, there is an absence of traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, and barriers.\n\nNo distinctly visible objects that could potentially impact driving, like debris or dustbins, are observed in the immediate vicinity. However, the low light conditions still demand heightened vigilance to anticipate and respond to any unexpected hazards that may arise as the ego car navigates through the area."
