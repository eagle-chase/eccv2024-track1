        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there's a bus positioned directly ahead of the ego vehicle, occupying the right-hand lane, and concurrently, a red car is situated on the left lane adjacent to the ego vehicle. The presence of both the bus and the red car restricts the ego vehicle's ability to maneuver, which necessitates heightened attention to their respective movements. This is particularly critical under challenging visibility conditions, such as during nighttime hours.\n\nMoreover, there are three sets of traffic lights in view, and all of them are displaying red signals. This mandates that all vehicles, inclusive of the ego car, must come to a complete stop and remain stationary until the lights transition to green."

            "description and explanation": "This is a large, yellow construction vehicle featuring multiple high-intensity lights on the top and the rear. A distinctive warning sign is mounted on its back, suggesting it may be performing or headed to perform utility or construction tasks. The presence of this vehicle can indicate nearby construction or maintenance work, thereby requiring the ego car to potentially reduce speed, increase following distance, and be prepared for sudden stops or detours. The influence on future driving behavior includes possible lane changes, slower traffic movement, and heightened alertness to the surrounding road conditions.",

Ensure the headlights and windshield are clear for maximum visibility. Since traffic lights are red, prepare to stop and wait for the light to change. Adjust speed to match the wet road conditions to prevent skidding."
