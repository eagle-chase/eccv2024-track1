The presence of these construction and emergency vehicles suggests ongoing activities that may disrupt normal traffic flow. Therefore, the ego car should be prepared for sudden stops, reduced speed limits, and potential movements from these vehicles.\n\nAdditionally, utility poles and overhead wires are observed along the roadside, which are standard features in urban environments. While these objects do not directly impact driving behavior, they indicate the presence of an urban setting where traffic conditions can change abruptly."

Its presence indicates some form of construction or maintenance work nearby which may influence the traffic flow or necessitate temporary traffic signs and diversions. The ego car must be vigilant for sudden stops, changes in traffic patterns, or the presence of construction workers and equipment on or near the roadway. Approaching this type of vehicle requires reduced speed and increased caution to handle potential hazards or disruptions in the normal flow of traffic.",
