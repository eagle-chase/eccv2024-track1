Additionally, the same traffic light is described as being green and located at the intersection ahead, allowing the ego car to continue moving forward with caution, particularly at the intersection.\n\nThere are no traffic cones or barriers in the image. However, there are other objects to be aware of: a large green dumpster is situated on the right-hand side of the road, and bicycles are leaning against a tree also on the right. These objects could potentially obstruct part of the roadway or cause pedestrians to walk onto the road to navigate around them. Therefore, the ego car should be vigilant when driving through these sections to ensure safety."
