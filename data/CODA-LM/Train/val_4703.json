This road user poses a safety risk, and the ego car must be ready to stop or slow down to avoid a collision.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a sign board that is not fully legible but appears to be informational, potentially indicating a residential or commercial area ahead. Although the exact message of the sign is unclear, it suggests that there may be potential hazards or changes in road conditions approaching.\n\nLastly, there is debris located on the right side of the road, not directly in the path of the ego car. The autonomous driving system should remain vigilant for any road debris that might enter its path and be prepared to respond accordingly.\n\nThe traffic image does not contain any traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers that need to be considered in this scenario."
