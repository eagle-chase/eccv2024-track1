Considering the ego vehicle, the parked car makes the lane width narrower, requiring care when the ego vehicle passes by. Also, there is a dimly lit area on the left side of the image. The light appears to originate from a building or a street light that's outside the frame of the camera. Although this illumination does not have a direct impact on how the ego car drives, it's an important environmental detail for maintaining visibility and awareness of the surroundings. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers observed in this particular traffic image."
