        "description and explanation": "The traffic image under consideration shows several parked cars on both sides of a narrow road. These vehicles are predominantly dark-colored and are parked closely to one another. The significance of these parked cars is that they effectively reduce the navigable width of the road. This situation heightens the risk of side swipes as moving vehicles have restricted space to maneuver. Additionally, there is a noted challenge in the image regarding low visibility and the lack of clear lane demarcations. This scenario is exacerbated by nighttime conditions coupled with inadequate street lighting. The reduced visibility makes it notably harder to discern road edges, identify obstacles, and observe other road users, which collectively increases the likelihood of accidents occurring."

The lighting conditions are low, indicating nighttime driving conditions. The presence of this parked vehicle is a potential hazard for the ego car. The driver of the ego car must ensure there is enough clearance to safely pass this vehicle without coming too close, which might risk a collision or scraping. Additionally, the ego car should moderate its speed and remain vigilant for any sudden movements from the parked vehicle, such as doors opening or the vehicle pulling out into traffic.",
