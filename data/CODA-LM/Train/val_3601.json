It is important for the self-driving vehicle to remain cautious, as the parked car may unexpectedly join the traffic, posing a potential risk.\n\nTwo construction workers are noticeable, wearing high-visibility jackets and standing in the road behind a small cart, which is positioned behind a series of orange traffic cones. The presence of workers within the travel path indicates a need for the autonomous vehicle to take extra care when navigating this section of the road.\n\nThere are orange traffic cones placed in the road that signal a work zone or a temporary obstruction. Accordingly, the vehicle's path must be adjusted to ensure safe passage around the work zone and maintain an appropriate safety buffer from the workers and their equipment.\n\nAdditionally, a barrier appears to be associated with the work zone, extending across the road and partially blocking the lane where the workers are stationed. The barrier informs of the temporary work area, which the self-driving vehicle must traverse with caution.\n\nFinally, there are bicycles parked to the right of the road, secured to a railing. Although these do not directly interfere with the vehicle's current trajectory, their presence suggests cyclists may be nearby, and as such, the vehicle should proceed with heightened alertness to the potential movement of cyclists into its path."
