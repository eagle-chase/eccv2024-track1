        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scenario, there are several key observations. Firstly, there is a large commercial vehicle positioned directly in front of our perspective with reflective signage. The size and nature of this vehicle suggest that it is likely traveling at a slower pace. It's important for the ego car to maintain a safe following distance from this vehicle and be ready to respond to any potential stops or alterations in its speed.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple passenger cars in the adjacent lanes which have their brake lights illuminated. This is a clear indication of potential congestion or slow-moving traffic ahead. Consequently, the ego car will need to exercise increased attention and caution, being prepared for potential stops or a need to reduce speed due to the traffic conditions."

Construction vehicles are typically involved in roadside or highway construction projects. They are equipped with tools or machinery for construction purposes. The presence of this vehicle in a traffic scenario may indicate ongoing construction or road maintenance work ahead. Drivers should be prepared for possible delays or detours, and it's crucial to maintain a safe following distance and reduced speed to navigate safely around such vehicles and any potential obstacles or work zones associated with them.",
