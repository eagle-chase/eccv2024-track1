Firstly, there is a large blue truck moving in the right lane, directly adjacent to the ego car. The size and proximity of the truck are important as they may restrict the ego car's ability to maneuver or change lanes safely. Additionally, there is a cement mixer truck positioned ahead in the left lane. Due to its larger size and potentially slower speed, the mixer truck could affect the ego car's speed and lane choice decisions.\n\nFurthermore, a cyclist is visible far ahead on the right side of the road, traveling in the same direction as the traffic. The ego car must pass the cyclist carefully, providing sufficient clearance to maintain safety.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that would impact the ego car's driving decisions."
