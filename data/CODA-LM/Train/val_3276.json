First, directly ahead in the center lane, there is a large vehicle with flashing lights which requires caution. This road maintenance truck is likely engaged in work activities, signaling the need for the ego car to be ready to stop or maneuver around the obstacle.\n\nTo the right side of the road and near the sidewalk, a cyclist has been observed. This vulnerable road user could potentially enter the driving lane unexpectedly, necessitating the ego car to stay alert, potentially slow down, and offer ample space to ensure the cyclistâ€™s safety.\n\nFurther ahead, a traffic light is visible over the top of the road maintenance truck displaying a green light, allowing the ego car to proceed. However, due to the proximity of the road maintenance vehicle, the driver is advised to advance with caution, adhering to traffic safety guidelines even with the right of way being indicated. \n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene, indicating a relatively clear passage except for the mentioned road users and traffic signal."

In this scenario, the presence of this vehicle directly ahead on a similar road trajectory suggests it might be moving slower than typical traffic flow due to its heavy load. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential sudden stops or reduced speeds from this construction vehicle. Additionally, the vehicle's frequent stops at construction sites or side roads can affect traffic flow, so the ego car should stay alert for any such activities.",
