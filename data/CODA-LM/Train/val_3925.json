However, there is a traffic sign visible; it is a blue rectangular sign with white Chinese characters and a 'no horn' symbol on the right side, located on the right side of the road. This sign serves as a notification to drivers that honking is not allowed in the area, likely implemented to avoid noise disturbance.\n\nAdditionally, there are orange traffic cones arranged along the edge of the road. These cones are set up to create a separation between the driving lane and a construction zone, signaling to drivers that they must steer clear of the area marked for maintenance. There are no traffic lights, barriers, or other objects in the image that affect driving behavior."
