This suggests the possibility of pedestrian or cyclist activity close to the area. The presence of the bicycle signifies a likelihood of someone returning to claim it, meaning there could be sudden pedestrian or cyclist movements near the roadway.\n\nAdditionally, under the category of other objects, the street's curb side features several garbage bags and smaller pieces of litter. These scattered elements pose potential risks, as they might unexpectedly shift or spill onto the roadway, necessitating that the ego car remains vigilant and potentially adjust its path to avoid hazards."
