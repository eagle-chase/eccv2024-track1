The presence of this truck directly impacts the driving decision of the ego car by requiring increased awareness and potentially adjusting speed, ensuring sufficient clearance around the truck, and being cautious of its turning movements which require wider arcing turns.",

Considering the obstruction and potential lack of visibility of the end of the truck trailer, the ego car would need to either stop and assess the situation or slowly navigate around the obstruction if safe passage is clear and there's enough space on the road. Use of high beams might be warranted to enhance visibility, but care should be taken not to blind other drivers."
