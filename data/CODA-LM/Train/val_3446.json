        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there is a single vehicle directly in front of the autonomous car which is described as a vehicle carrying heavy machinery, obstructing the view ahead. The presence of this vehicle demands cautious driving behavior; given its slow movement and significant size, the autonomous car should maintain a safe following distance and be ready to stop or navigate around the vehicle if necessary. Additionally, red brake lights are observed on the machinery vehicle, which indicates that it is decelerating or approaching a stop. As a result, the autonomous car must be prepared to lower its speed or come to a complete stop in response to the vehicle's actions.\n\nMoreover, a road sign indicating an electronic toll collection (ETC) gate ahead is also present. This informs the autonomous car that there is an impending toll gate, which could influence its speed and lane selection as it approaches the area.\n\nLastly, concrete barriers are located on the right-hand side of the lane, limiting the ability of the autonomous car to move right. This may suggest the presence of a construction site or a lane closure in that area. The car will have to take note of the barriers to remain safely within its lane, as maneuvering options to the right are restricted."
