This vehicle is significantly larger and appears to be quite slow, potentially leading to traffic delays and obstructions. Directly in front of the ego car, there is also a white sedan. The sedan's proximity is crucial as it dictates the following distance and speed adjustments for the ego vehicle. Additionally, a bus is present in the left lane ahead, displaying a route destination on its digital display. Buses often make frequent stops, which can affect traffic flow and require the ego vehicle to maintain a careful watch for stopping and starting movements.\n\nAt the intersection ahead, traffic lights are visible, currently displaying a red light. The red light requires all vehicles to stop, and the ego car must comply with this traffic control to avoid accidents and ensure road safety."
