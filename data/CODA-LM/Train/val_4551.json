        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are two vehicles that are of interest. The first is a white sedan parked on the right side of the road, facing the same direction as the ego car. The presence of this parked vehicle necessitates that the ego car maintain a safe passing distance to avoid any potential hazards such as sudden door openings or the vehicle pulling out into traffic. The second vehicle is a black vehicle ahead in the same lane as the ego car, with its brake lights illuminated. This indicates that the vehicle is either coming to a stop or reducing its speed, and as a result, the ego car must be ready to slow down or come to a stop depending on the actions of the black vehicle. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
