The motion blur and reflection on its body indicate it is likely traveling at a significant speed. The presence of this car influences the future driving behavior by necessitating cautious and attentive driving from the ego car, particularly in maintaining a safe following distance and being prepared for sudden changes in the other car's speed or direction. This observation is crucial, especially during night driving where visibility and reaction times might be reduced.",

The ego car should also ensure its headlights and windscreen wipers are functioning correctly to improve visibility. Monitoring the SUV's brake lights and indicators for any sudden changes in its driving behavior is advised. Additionally, reducing speed to match the condition of the road will be safer and provide more reaction time."
