        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there are two vehicles of interest. The first is a large yellow construction vehicle equipped with a rotating brush mechanism. It is notable for occupying the right side and partially the lane intended for the autonomous vehicle (ego car), which necessitates caution due to the possible risk of collision and the likelihood of it causing an obstruction in the traffic flow. The second road user is a motorcyclist, distinguishable by a red jacket and positioned on the far-right side of the road. This proximity to the ego car and the potential for unpredictable movements by the motorcyclist call for increased vigilance to prevent any accidents. The information regarding vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects is not applicable in this image, as those categories are not present."

            "description and explanation": "This is a construction vehicle, specifically a wheel loader, characterized by its large front-mounted bucket and robust, heavy-duty tires. It is generally used in construction settings for moving large quantities of materials such as dirt, gravel, or debris. In road traffic contexts, the presence of a construction vehicle like this often indicates ongoing construction work nearby, which can affect traffic flow. Drivers should be cautious when approaching, anticipating potential slow-downs, diversions, or uneven road surfaces and modify their driving behavior accordingly.",

Additionally, the ego car should continuously monitor the motorcyclist's movements and be prepared to adjust its driving accordingly. It is advisable to check the mirrors frequently and consider a lane change if it is safe to do so, to avoid being too close to the construction vehicle and the motorcyclist."
