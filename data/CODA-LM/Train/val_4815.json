Although this vehicle is stationary and properly parked, its presence should be noted as the surroundings may change and could influence driving behavior.\n\nA vertical red and white striped pole, likely attached to a guard booth, is positioned on the right corner relative to the ego car's position. This pole is probably indicative of a no entry sign or a controlled access point, suggesting that the ego car should not proceed through this path.\n\nMultiple small, green cones are seen demarcating an area on the right side of the road in front of the parked black sedan. These cones signal the boundaries of a potentially off-limits area, indicating roadwork or a restricted zone; thus, the ego car must avoid entering this area.\n\nA concrete and metal guard booth is extending over the path of the ego car on the right side, with vertical elements that might obstruct passage. This significant obstruction suggests that the path may be designated for authorized vehicles only or is not a regular thoroughfare, necessitating a route change or stopping to assess the situation.\n\nLastly, an unkempt yellow barrier is present immediately to the right of the ego car's path, along with maintenance or garbage-related debris scattered on the ground near the barrier. These objects could be hazardous for navigation, requiring the ego car to reduce speed and proceed with caution."
