These vehicles are stationary and occupy part of the shoulder, which narrows the usable width of the road for the ego vehicle. Additionally, there are cars ahead in the same lane, traveling in the same direction as the ego vehicle. The movement of these cars dictates the flow of traffic and may influence the speed and following distance of the ego car. Furthermore, the parked construction vehicles also act as physical barriers limiting the road space.
