The truck has a visible mixing drum, illuminated rear lights, and an operational structure in sight. This truck significantly influences the driving behavior of the ego car due to its size and the potential for dropping debris from the mixer. It also restricts visibility ahead and reduces options for maneuvering around it.\n\nAdditionally, a traffic light is visible in front of the ego car. The traffic light shows a green light for turning left and a red light for going straight or turning right. This traffic light dictates the movement direction, permitting only a left turn while prohibiting direct proceeding or turning right until the light changes."
