        "description and explanation": "In this traffic scenario, there are several parked cars on both sides of the street under insufficient street lighting. The presence of these vehicles reduces the available road space and can obstruct the view of moving vehicles or pedestrians trying to navigate between them. This requires cautious driving to ensure the safety of all road users.\n\nAdditionally, a green traffic light is visible in the distance on the right side of the road. The green light signals that there is permission for traffic to move in the direction in which the ego car is traveling or potentially in a cross direction. This information is helpful for understanding the traffic flow at the intersection and aids in the anticipation of potential movements of other road users.\n\nThere are no other road users such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects identified in the image, which simplifies the driving scenario to some extent. However, the driver, or the autonomous driving system, must remain vigilant, especially considering the limited visibility posed by the poor street lighting and the parked cars."
