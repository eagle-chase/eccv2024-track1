Firstly, there's a white and green concrete mixer truck ahead in the left lane, which could hinder visibility and limit movement options for our vehicle. As a response, the autonomous system may need to reduce speed or consider a lane change for safety.\n\nSecondly, parked on the street's right side is a white van, followed closely by a gray SUV. Although these vehicles are stationary, they could present potential risks if they or any pedestrians nearby suddenly enter the roadway. The presence of these vehicles necessitates increased awareness.\n\nAdding to these considerations, there's a pedestrian crossing in front of us. The marked zebra crossing suggests that we should approach with caution and be prepared to halt for pedestrians that may cross.\n\nLastly, the image also shows raindrops and reflections on the windshield, obscuring the view. This weather condition could compromise the detection capabilities of the autonomous vehicle, necessitating a more cautious driving style to accommodate reduced visibility.\n\nIn this scenario, the autonomous driving system must account for fixed obstacles like the parked vehicles, potential pedestrian activity at the zebra crossing, and visibility reduction due to weather effects, all while navigating safely through the environment."

The driver should slow down and be extra vigilant for pedestrians that might cross at the zebra crossing, and be aware of vehicles potentially pulling out from the right. Additionally, due to reduced visibility from the wet windshield, using windshield wipers to improve sight lines is recommended."
