There's a blue construction barrier on the right side of the scene, demarcating an ongoing construction zone, which defines the safe driving limits.\n\nAdditionally, the road is littered with loose gravel and has an uneven surface, potentially affecting the vehicle's traction and handling, thus requiring a reduction in speed and heightened caution while driving. Other categories such as traffic signs and traffic lights have no entries, indicating they are not present in this traffic image."
