Firstly, there is a white car parked on the right side of the road, partially on the pavement. This improperly parked car may obstruct the flow of traffic and could lead to unexpected movements from the vehicle, which the ego vehicle must be cautious of. Additionally, an orange construction frontend loader is positioned on the left side of the road, facing the ego vehicle. This indicates ongoing construction work, and the loader could start moving or there may be construction workers in the vicinity, necessitating extra caution.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a bicycle leaning on the railing without a rider. While it currently does not pose a direct threat, the return of the bicycle's owner could be unpredictable, and thus it is important for the ego vehicle to remain aware of this possibility.\n\nLastly, there are signboards and bicycles parked on the right-side pavement. These objects could obstruct the view of the ego vehicle or lead to unexpected movements by pedestrians or cyclists entering the road, which must be taken into account when navigating the area.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image, so these categories do not need to be considered in this scenario."
