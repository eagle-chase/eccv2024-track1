However, there are red and white barriers visible on the left side of the road. These barriers indicate a lane closure or obstruction, potentially due to construction or an event, signaling the need for caution and possibly a change in the usual traffic flow or driving behavior for the ego car. There are also no other objects, such as debris or dustbins, noted in the image."

It is brightly colored, usually in red and white, to ensure high visibility. Barriers like this are crucial in guiding vehicles away from prohibited or dangerous areas and help in maintaining orderly traffic flow. In this scenario, the presence of the barrier indicates that there may be construction, an accident, or some form of roadwork ahead. The ego car must slow down and prepare to possibly change lanes or navigate around the obstacle cautiously.",
