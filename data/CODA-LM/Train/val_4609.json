            "description and explanation": "This is a construction vehicle, specifically a cement mixer truck. It has a large rotating drum used to mix cement components, visible in a complex configuration of machinery and supports. The presence of this construction vehicle suggests ongoing or imminent construction or roadwork. Its placement on the road can influence the ego car's driving behavior by necessitating a reduction in speed, increased caution, and potentially changing lanes to maintain safe distance from the operations. Additionally, the construction vehicle may intermittently obstruct traffic flow, requiring drivers to watch for sudden stops or merging workers and machinery.",

The driver should also be alert for any oncoming traffic that might be obscured by the truck's large size. Furthermore, caution should be taken due to the shadows on the road which may hide potential hazards."
