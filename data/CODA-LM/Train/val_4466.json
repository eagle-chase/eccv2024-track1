This vehicle reduces the width of the usable roadway and increases the risk of the ego car needing to maneuver around it, potentially into oncoming traffic.\n\nSecondly, an SUV is parked next to the sedan and is also encroaching into the driving lane. This situation similarly reduces maneuverability for the ego car and increases the likelihood of traffic conflicts or accidents.\n\nNo other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in this traffic image."

It appears to be parked or stationary, as indicated by its position relative to other vehicles and the lack of motion blur. In a driving scenario, the presence of this car influences the ego car by potentially restricting maneuverability or lane choice, depending on whether it starts moving or remains parked. The ego car must maintain a safe distance and be prepared to stop or navigate around if the car moves into the flow of traffic or if any doors open suddenly.",
