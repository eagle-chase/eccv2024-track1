        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene before the ego car, there's a large truck directly ahead. It's mostly white, appears to be equipped for construction purposes, and has the license plate 'BDG2177'. This vehicle poses a challenge due to its size and proximity, which may cause visibility issues for the driver of the ego car. It's important to maintain a sufficient following distance and be prepared for any sudden maneuvers the truck may perform.\n\nTo the right of the ego car, a motorcyclist is riding in parallel. The presence of the motorcyclist is a reminder to drive with extra caution, given that they are not as easily seen and are more at risk in traffic than larger, more protected vehicles. Special attention should be given when turning or shifting lanes to ensure the motorcyclist's safety.\n\nAbove the front end of the truck, there is a traffic light suspended in the air, currently showing green. This allows the ego car to continue on its route, but the driver should remain vigilant of both the conditions on the road and the potential for the traffic light to change, warranting a prompt and appropriate reaction."

Due to its substantial size and operational requirements, this vehicle often moves slower and makes more frequent stops compared to regular traffic. When driving near such a vehicle, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for unexpected slowdowns or stops, especially in areas near construction sites where this vehicle might be heading to or departing from.",
