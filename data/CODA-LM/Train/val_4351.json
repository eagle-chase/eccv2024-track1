The bright rear lights can cause glare especially during night driving, urging caution."

        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, there is a single vehicle present â€” a large truck with a red container situated directly in front of the ego car. It is described as being equipped with a rear lighting system and reflective elements. As for its impact on driving behavior, the presence of the truck reduces the visibility of the road ahead for the ego car and also necessitates maintaining a safe following distance and speed. Additionally, the truck's bright rear lights could lead to glare, particularly when driving at night, thereby requiring extra caution from the driver of the ego car. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects identified in the scene."

            "description and explanation": "The object is a large commercial vehicle typically used for transporting goods. It has high-intensity lights that are clearly visible, indicating it is active and possibly in operation. As a truck often moves slower than smaller vehicles and requires more space for maneuvers such as turning or stopping, the ego car must maintain an appropriate distance to ensure safety. Additionally, these kinds of vehicles may make sudden stops or slow down to navigate through different road conditions or to follow traffic regulations, thus it is critical for the driver of the ego car to be alert and prepare for unexpected behaviors from the truck.",
