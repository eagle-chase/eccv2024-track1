        "description and explanation": "In the image, we observe a couple of noticeable vehicles. A large yellow truck is present on the right side of the picture, traveling in the same direction as the ego car. The size of the truck and the fact it's carrying construction machinery are potential hazards since the load could be unstable or the truck might make unpredictable movements. Additionally, a crane is mounted on a platform vehicle on the left side; it is stationary and encroaches slightly into the ego car's lane. As a result, the crane narrows the lane available to the ego car and could lead to unexpected obstructions.\n\nAs we move our focus, there's a traffic sign on the right, ahead of the ego car, which signifies either a mandatory right turn or lane merging. This information is vital because it prepares the driver to adjust the vehicle's lane or reduce speed to adapt to the upcoming change in road layout.\n\nOver at the intersection, there's a traffic light displaying green, indicating that vehicles, including the ego car, have the right to proceed. However, caution is advised due to potential sudden stops or activity related to the construction area.\n\nSurrounding the crane, we see orange traffic cones demarcating the boundary of the construction zone. These traffic cones serve to redirect the traffic flow safely around the construction and highlight the areas that the ego car must avoid to prevent an accident with the stationary crane.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, barriers, or other objects are present in this image according to the provided data."
