        "description and explanation": "The current traffic environment encompasses a variety of road users and signals. Directly ahead of the ego car moves a large cement truck, which due to its size and function, could impede visibility and drop debris, creating a potential hazard that must be accounted for. On the left side of the ego car, there is a white sedan whose proximity necessitates vigilance to avert any side collisions that could arise from unexpected lateral movements. The traffic field also includes multiple traffic lights visible above the current and adjacent lanes; these are showing red and yellow signals, indicating the need for the ego car to either prepare to stop or maintain a stationary position if already stopped. Furthermore, there are road barriers situated on the left-hand side of the road; these serve as dividers between the current lane of the ego car and the lanes for oncoming traffic. They also signify limited maneuverability on the left, emphasizing the importance of strict lane discipline. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects reported in this scene that warrant attention or action from the ego car."

This type of vehicle is often found near construction sites where infrastructure development or building construction is taking place. For the ego car, the presence of this construction vehicle indicates potential hazards due to the truck's larger blind spots, frequent stopping and starting, and the possibility of sudden movements as it maneuvers to and from construction sites. The ego car must maintain a safe distance and be prepared for unexpected stops or debris coming from the vehicle.",

Continuously monitor the white sedan to the left to avoid any potential side collisions. Ensure that the car remains well within the lane boundaries, especially given the barriers and limited maneuverability to the left."
