The truck is only partially visible, with its rear section extending into the travel lane. This parked truck is significant because it occupies part of the lane, which reduces the available space for the ego car to maneuver safely. Additionally, there is a cylindrical barrier, which might be a concrete mixer, that has fallen over into the right lane of the road. This barrier completely blocks the right lane, compelling all traffic to use the left lane. This situation requires extra caution for the ego car, particularly because of the need to navigate around the parked truck. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

For the ego car, this object necessitates cautious driving to ensure safe passage around the barrier without coming too close, potentially adjusting the driving path to avoid any contact with it.",
