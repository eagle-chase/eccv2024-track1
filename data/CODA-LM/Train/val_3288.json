While this car is not affecting the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle at the present time, it must be monitored in case it initiates movement. Additionally, there is a pedestrian accompanied by a dog walking on the sidewalk on the right side of the road, facing away from the self-driving car. Although the pedestrian is not on the road, their proximity necessitates a cautious approach by the autonomous vehicle, which should be ready to stop if the pedestrian unexpectedly enters the street.\n\nOn the left side of the road, there are orange and white traffic barriers, signifying a closed-off area, possibly due to construction or other disruptions. Thus, the autonomous vehicle should be aware of changes in the traffic pattern and might have to alter its driving route accordingly.\n\nClose to the parked car, there are dustbins on the right side of the road. While these dustbins are not currently a hazard, they should nevertheless be observed in case they are moved onto the road and become an obstacle.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones present in the image that could influence the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle."
