However, there are other objects of interest. To the right side of the road, large industrial cable reels and other equipment are stored off the road and against a wall. While these objects do not directly impede the vehicle's path, it is important for the autonomous driving system to be aware of their presence. This awareness is crucial in the event of any unexpected movements or if the ego car's path shifts closer to the roadside."

It is a static object and does not influence the movement or operation of vehicles on the road directly. However, its presence on the roadside may catch the attention of drivers.

Given its size and the industrial setting, it's likely associated with telecommunications or electrical utilities. When driving near such objects, especially if they are near the roadside, caution is advised as they may indicate the presence of nearby work zones or utility workers. Furthermore, these objects being close to the road might require drivers to be more vigilant to avoid collisions or obstructions, particularly in areas where equipment might be suddenly moved or where vehicles might be parked.",
