        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a large, white truck that appears to be heavily used, with visible wear and dirt marks. It's captured from its right side and has red reflective stickers on its rear. Since the truck is moving on the road, it represents a significant factor to consider for the autonomous driving system. The truck's size and implied slower movement, along with the potential to make wide turns, are critical for the ego car's driving decisions. Therefore, the autonomous system must plan overtaking maneuvers carefully or maintain a safe following distance from the truck. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the traffic image that would affect the autonomous driving system's behavior."

It is the base of the cargo bed, which is primarily constructed from metal and displays signs of wear and corrosion. This type of object influences the driving behavior of nearby vehicles, especially in terms of safety and maneuverability. Vehicles, including the ego car, need to maintain a safe distance and be cautious of the truck's larger blind spots and potential for wide turns.",
