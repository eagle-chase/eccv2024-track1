A white car is visible ahead on the same lane as the ego car, positioned on the right side of the road. This white car is in motion and given its location directly in front of the ego car, it could affect the speed at which the ego vehicle travels as well as how much distance the ego car needs to maintain behind it for safety.\n\nAdditionally, a truck is utilizing the left lane and is only partially in the ego vehicle's field of view. The positioning of the truck may obstruct part of the road and could also limit the visibility for the ego car driver. This situation requires the ego vehicle to be driven with increased caution to safely navigate around the truck or to remain at a safe following distance until the road ahead becomes fully visible.\n\nFinally, important for the ego car's immediate behavior is the presence of three traffic lights at the intersection. Two of these are for the right side and one for the left, and all are currently displaying a red light. This means that the ego car is required to come to a complete stop at this intersection and wait until the lights change to green before it can continue its journey. \n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are described in the given data. Therefore, they do not need to be considered for the current driving situation."
