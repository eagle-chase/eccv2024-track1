These cars need to be observed by the ego vehicle to anticipate any potential merge into its lane, thereby affecting lane-changing decisions.\n\nA red traffic light is ahead of the ego vehicle and the white car, mandating a full stop at the intersection to adhere to traffic laws and maintain safety procedures.\n\nOrange traffic cones are positioned in the right lane, indicating that it is currently unavailable, potentially due to roadworks or an obstruction. This requires vehicles in the right lane to merge left.\n\nMetal barriers are present on both sides of the road, delineating the driving area and preventing any interactions between vehicles and pedestrians or other parts of the infrastructure.\n\nAdditionally, there are yellow portable barriers on the sidewalk to the right, with a red sign that could signify ongoing roadworks or alterations in traffic patterns. It suggests that drivers should be alert to changes or disruptions in the traffic flow which may demand extra attention."
