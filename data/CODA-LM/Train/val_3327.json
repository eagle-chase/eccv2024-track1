The truck appears to be either stopped or moving very slowly since its rear lights are illuminated. This stationary truck creates a potential road hazard and will necessitate that the autonomous car either slows down or switches lanes to maintain safety. Additionally, there's a traffic light displaying a red color located above the right side of the truck, signaling the need for the autonomous vehicle to be prepared to stop or yield as per the traffic condition ahead. Other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects are not present or relevant in this image."

Due to its size and potential lower speed relative to other motor vehicles, the ego car must maintain a safe following distance and possibly change lanes to safely overtake. The presence of this tricycle on the road emphasizes the need for the ego car to adjust speed and monitor surrounding traffic conditions to ensure a safe maneuver.",
