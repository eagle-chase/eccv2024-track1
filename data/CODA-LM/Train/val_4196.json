On both sides of the road, there are multiple cars parked, including a blue car facing the ego car on the right side. These parked cars reduce the available driving space and could obscure the view of any pedestrians or vehicles that may emerge suddenly, necessitating caution and preparedness for rapid response.\n\nAdditionally, a red car is observed driving away from the ego car on the left side of the road, which is part of the normal flow of traffic. However, it is important to keep an eye on this vehicle for any unexpected maneuvers such as sudden stops or turns.\n\nA pedestrian accompanied by a dog is crossing the street from right to left at a designated crosswalk. This pedestrian has the right-of-way, and it is imperative for the ego car to yield, as they are directly in the potential path of the vehicle, presenting a safety concern.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a directional sign attached to a light pole. This sign is important for providing guidance on traffic directions and information about the road layout, which is essential for making navigation decisions.\n\nLastly, there are bicycles parked on the sidewalk to the right. While they are not in the roadway, they could still obstruct visibility or become hazards if they were to fall or be moved into the path of traffic.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."
