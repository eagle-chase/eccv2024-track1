This indicates that the vehicle is either stopped or moving slowly, and as a result, it directly influences the driving speed and following distance of the ego car.\n\nAdditionally, there is a group of pedestrians, including bike riders, gathered on the right side of the road near shops and parked scooters. The proximity of these pedestrians to the roadway presents a potential hazard as they may unexpectedly enter the road. Consequently, the ego car must monitor this situation carefully.\n\nFurthermore, concrete barriers are present on the left side of the road, delineating the road lanes from the on-ramp. These barriers are significant as they define the lane boundaries and affect the lane choices and maneuvering options available to the ego car.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the scene that impact the driving behavior of the ego car."
