Their presence could lead to potential unpredictable movements into the lane of the ego car, necessitating cautious and slower driving.\n\n3. **Traffic Signs**:\n   - Red traffic lights are visible at the intersection ahead. This indicates that the ego car needs to prepare to stop if the lights remain red upon approach.\n   - There are likely active road work signs in the area, suggested by the presence of construction workers and setup.
