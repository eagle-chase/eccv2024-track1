A yellow taxi is positioned directly ahead on the same road, running parallel to the ego car. This presence is crucial as the taxi's actions, such as stopping or turning, could directly affect the driving behavior of the ego car.\n\nAdditionally, two pedestrians, who appear to be workers based on their clothing, are noticed near the road's center divider, with one potentially stepping onto the road. The proximity and uncertain intentions of these individuals necessitate the ego car to maintain cautious observation and potentially reduce speed to ensure safety.\n\nOn the right-hand side, there is a blue traffic sign with an arrow and Chinese characters, presumably indicating directions to a gate or other notable location. While this sign is mainly informational for orientation purposes, it is not an immediate influencer on driving decisions.\n\nThe right lane is partially obstructed by several orange traffic cones that guide traffic toward a particular driving path. As a result, the ego car might need to shift to the left lane due to the constrained driving space.\n\nOutside the immediate driving area to the right, there is a dustbin and brooms leaning against a building. These are not concerns for the vehicle's current path but must be monitored in case they are accidentally displaced onto the road."
