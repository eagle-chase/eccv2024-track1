The bus affects the lateral movement and possible lane changes of the ego car, requiring cautious driving and awareness of the bus's actions.\n\nAdditionally, there is a road sign visible on the right, likely a regulatory sign indicating no entry or a similar restriction. This sign informs the ego car of prohibitions or specific rules ahead, affecting its route decisions and adherence to traffic laws.\n\nWhite and blue traffic barriers are present on both sides of a narrowed lane, directing the traffic. These barriers signal lane narrowing or road work, necessitating reduced speed and increased caution.\n\nFurther, solid, continuous barriers are present mainly on the right side of the road, guiding traffic flow and restricting road width. These barriers enforce a confined driving path and limit the maneuverability of the ego vehicle."

The cyclist, transporting goods with a reflective helmet for visibility, rides on the right edge of the lane. For the ego car, this presence indicates the necessity of maintaining a cautious speed and ensuring a safe passing distance. The cyclist's positioning and movement might lead to adjustments in the driving strategy, such as slowing down and possibly changing lanes to pass safely, considering their vulnerability on the road, especially under low-light conditions.",
