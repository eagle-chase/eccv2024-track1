        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scenario, there are no vehicles, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present. However, there is a motorcyclist on the right side of the traffic lane, who is traveling in the same direction as the ego vehicle. Notably, the motorcycle has a small trailer attached. The presence of the motorcyclist is critical as it reduces the space available for the ego vehicle to maneuver or change lanes. Given that motorcycles can be less stable and are sometimes harder to see, the ego vehicle must maintain a vigilant watch over the motorcyclist, particularly in low visibility conditions like nighttime."

Cyclists share the road with motorized vehicles and must follow the same traffic rules. For the ego car in this scenario, the presence of the cyclist will necessitate caution and potentially slower speeds to ensure safe passing distance. The ego car might also need to alter its path slightly or wait until it can safely overtake the cyclist without close contact.",

Monitor surrounding traffic and continue to assess the road conditions as visible."
