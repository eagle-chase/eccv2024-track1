The bus may start moving or passengers might disembark, potentially affecting the ego vehicle's path and speed adjustments to avoid obstructions.\n- A construction truck is stationed near the median on the right, partially obstructed from view. Its proximity to the road suggests ongoing construction, which may lead to obstructions or require the ego vehicle to reduce speed.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n- A pedestrian is moving towards the left side of the road near the median. Their movement close to the road could lead to them stepping onto the carriageway, necessitating the ego vehicle to be ready to stop or slow down significantly.\n\nTraffic Signs:\n- A round blue sign with an arrow indicating straight on or right turn is located next to the construction area on the right. This sign informs the ego vehicle of the allowable movements at this junction and indicates the need to stay in the correct lane for the intended direction.\n\nTraffic Lights:\n- Traffic lights are present above the road near the middle of the image, but their state is not visible. The ego vehicle must watch these lights for changes to determine when to stop, go, or prepare for turns.\n\nTraffic Cones:\n- Several traffic cones create a barrier on the road on the construction side. These cones delineate areas the ego vehicle should avoid, aiding in safe navigation past the construction zone.\n\nBarriers:\n- Wooden barriers and a striped pole are set up around the construction site adjacent to the road. These barriers demarcate the construction zone, requiring the ego vehicle to keep a safe distance and potentially change lanes.\n\nOther Objects:\n- Multiple bins are lined up on the roadside, and there is construction-related debris near the truck. These could become obstacles if displaced onto the roadway, so the ego vehicle needs to monitor these conditions and respond if the path becomes obstructed."
