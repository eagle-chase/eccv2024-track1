These vehicles influence the ego car's driving behavior by affecting the available space and requiring careful speed adjustment, as the lanes seem to be converging.\n\nIn addition to the vehicles, there is a pedestrian dressed in high visibility clothing. This individual is standing in the roadway in front of a traffic barrier and appears to be directing traffic, presumably due to ongoing roadwork. This pedestrian plays a crucial role in influencing the ego car's driving path and speed, especially given the direct interaction with the traffic.\n\nThe traffic light visible in the distance is showing green. This green light permits vehicular movement in the ego car's current direction, signaling that proceeding with caution is acceptable but the ego car must be ready to stop if the situation changes.\n\nThe scene also includes multiple reflective traffic cones positioned around the work zone, creating a narrowed driving path. These cones direct the traffic flow and reduce lane width, thereby requiring the ego car to slow down and maneuver carefully through the narrowed area.\n\nTemporary barriers are present alongside the roadwork area, blocking off construction zones from the roadway.
