It is imperative for the safety of these individuals that the ego vehicle yields and, if required, stops to allow them to safely complete their crossing.\n\nOn the right side of the road, near the sidewalk, there is an accumulation of trash bags and loose debris. The ego car might need to steer slightly away from the curb to safely navigate around these potential obstructions and avoid debris that could enter the roadway.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other notable objects impacting the autonomous vehicle's driving decisions in this scenario. The aforementioned road users and objects are the only ones requiring attention and careful maneuvering by the ego vehicle."
