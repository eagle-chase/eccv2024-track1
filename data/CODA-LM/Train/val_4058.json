This vehicle's positioning reduces the drivable width of the roadway, thus requiring the ego car to carefully maneuver through the narrowed space.\n\nAdditionally, there is a motorcyclist traveling in the same direction as the ego car, positioned on the left side of the lane. The rider is dressed in a dark jacket and helmet and is seen from behind. Due to the smaller size and increased vulnerability of motorcycles in traffic, the ego car must pay extra attention to this road user, since any abrupt changes in the motorcyclist's trajectory or speed could necessitate immediate adjustments in the ego car's driving behavior.\n\nLastly, the environment includes overhead cables stretching across the street and graffiti on the walls beside the street. These elements don't have a direct influence on the driving decisions but are nonetheless aspects of the surroundings that are noted. \n\nAll other categories such as traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects are not present in this specific traffic image and thus do not factor into the scenario."

Additionally, the sun glare requires that the driver be especially attentive to visibility and road conditions. Use of sunglasses or visor could help in improving visibility."
