        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, several key elements are present that influence driving behavior and decision-making for the ego car. Firstly, there is a white van improperly parked in the rightmost driving lane, directly in front of the ego car. This van is partially obstructing the lane and is slightly hidden by a pedestrian, posing a potential hazard by disrupting the flow of traffic and necessitating that vehicles navigate around it to maintain safety and traffic efficiency.\n\nAdditionally, the scene includes multiple other vehicles in various lanes around the ego car, such as a red car to the left and others positioned ahead at a distance. These vehicles contribute to the overall traffic density, affecting the ego car's speed and lane choice decisions. It is essential for the ego car to monitor the speeds and lane positions of these vehicles closely to ensure safe following distances and to be prepared for any sudden lane changes or stops they might make.\n\nA pedestrian, identified as possibly male, is also observed walking in front of the white van, moving from right to left across the ego car's field of vision. This pedestrian is crossing the street outside of a designated crosswalk, presenting an increased risk of collision. It is imperative for the ego car to pay immediate attention to this pedestrian to ensure their safety, as they are considered a vulnerable road user in this context.\n\nRegarding traffic control devices, the scene includes traffic lights that are showing green for going straight and red for turning left. This information is crucial as it dictates the permissible maneuvers for the ego car, allowing it to proceed straight while prohibiting left turns at this junction.\n\nLastly, an additional object, a cone, is visible on the road near the pedestrian in front of the van. This cone likely signifies temporary road works or hazards, serving as a guide for traffic flow and indicating areas that vehicles should avoid due to potential unsafe conditions on the road.\n\nIn summary, the traffic scene is complex, with various elements including improperly parked vehicles, dense traffic, vulnerable road users, traffic lights indicating permissible maneuvers, and signs of potential road hazards. Each of these factors plays a significant role in the driving behavior and decisions required by the ego car to navigate the scene safely."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a pedestrian wearing a dark jacket and dark pants. This pedestrian is crossing the street, partially visible in front of a moving vehicle. In driving scenarios, pedestrians have the right of way when crossing streets in marked or unmarked crosswalks. As a result, the ego car should reduce its speed and prepare to stop if necessary to avoid endangering the pedestrian. Observing pedestrians closely is crucial especially at night or under poor visibility conditions, ensuring safe and courteous driving behavior.",
