These parked vehicles could obstruct the view for the ego vehicle, making it important to reduce speed and proceed cautiously to avoid any sudden emergence of pedestrians or other vehicles from behind these parked vehicles.\n\nAdditionally, there are vulnerable road users. A pedestrian is visible further down the road, walking in the same direction as the ego vehicle on the right side. Pedestrians near the roadway could step into the street unexpectedly, necessitating alert driving and readiness to stop. There is also a motorcyclist parked next to a pedestrian phone booth on the right side of the road. Motorcyclists might start moving unpredictably, hence maintaining a safe following distance and being aware of their movements is crucial.\n\nIn this image, there are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present."
