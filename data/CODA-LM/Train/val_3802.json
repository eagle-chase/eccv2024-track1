The presence of the large truck, whether parked or moving slowly, could obstruct or narrow the driving lane for the ego car. This situation requires the driver to be cautious and may necessitate lane adjustments to safely navigate around the truck.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple yellow traffic cones arranged in a line towards the right side of the road. These cones are likely indicating a construction zone or road obstructions. As a result, part of the road may be closed off, and the driver will need to navigate carefully around this area to continue driving safely.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects reported in the image."

In this nighttime setting, it appears to be carrying goods, as suggested by visible outlines of potentially loaded items. Such vehicles typically move slower than cars and may not have prominent lights, making them less visible and potentially a hazard in low light conditions. The ego vehicle must adapt by ensuring a safe distance is maintained, lowering the vehicle speed accordingly, and using enhanced alertness to predict sudden stops or directional changes of the tricycle.",
