This vehicle is typically heavy and moves slower than standard passenger cars. The presence of this construction vehicle on the road could suggest ongoing or nearby construction work. Consequently, for the ego car, maintaining a safe following distance is crucial. Additionally, the ego car's driver should be alert for potential sudden stops or debris falling from the truck, which might also dictate a reduced speed to ensure safety.",

Continuously monitor the behavior of the oncoming blue sedan and motorcyclist for any unexpected maneuvers. No aggressive overtaking or sudden lane changes should be made, considering the wet road surface and the heavy vehicle ahead."
