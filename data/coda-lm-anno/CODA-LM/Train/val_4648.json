As a result, the ego vehicle must come to a stop and wait for the light to turn green before it can safely continue on its way, in accordance with traffic laws and to maintain safety.\n\nThere is also a significant glare present in the scene, possibly from a headlight or streetlight. This glare has the potential to compromise visibility, impeding the driver's or autonomous system's ability to discern other road users or traffic signs, which underscores the need for extra caution."
