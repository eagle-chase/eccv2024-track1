Since it is parked, it directly influences the driving behavior of the ego car by requiring careful navigation to safely pass without colliding, maintaining an adequate distance to avoid any unforeseen movements from the parked car, such as a door opening or the car pulling back onto the road. The presence of this parked car also reduces the available road width, necessitating reduced speed and increased alertness especially in a low-light environment.",
