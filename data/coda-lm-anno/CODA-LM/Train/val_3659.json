There are no visible traffic lights in operation or relevant to the ego car's direction, allowing the vehicle to proceed without waiting for a traffic signal. However, the ego car should stay vigilant for any other signage or road users that may dictate the right of way.\n\nAn orange traffic cone is placed on the road near the center line, signaling a potential hazard or lane closure. The ego car should slow down and be prepared to change lanes if necessary to avoid the cone and any potential hazard it represents.\n\nA metal fence separates the sidewalk from the roadway along the left side, ensuring that pedestrians do not enter the roadway. This allows the ego car to focus on road users within the driving lanes without concern for pedestrian interference.\n\nLastly, there are no other significant objects visible in the image that affect driving behavior, so the ego car can proceed with normal driving vigilance."
