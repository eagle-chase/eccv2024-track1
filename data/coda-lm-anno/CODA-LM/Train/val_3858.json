Typically used for roadwork or construction tasks, this vehicle's presence on the road suggests active or upcoming construction or maintenance work. For the driver of the ego car, it is crucial to approach with caution, potentially reducing speed and staying alert for sudden stops or movements from the construction vehicle. Awareness of surroundings should be heightened and readiness to follow any temporary traffic signs or signals near the construction site should be prioritized.",
