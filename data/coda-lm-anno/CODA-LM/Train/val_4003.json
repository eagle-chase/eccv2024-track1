Overhead, there are directional road signs; however, they are not affecting immediate driving behavior as they are merely providing navigational information without altering the current driving conditions.\n\nMoreover, the right lane has been marked with multiple traffic cones arranged diagonally, leading into the left lane, instructing drivers to change lanes to avoid the obstruction caused by the construction work. Alongside this, there are temporary fences and barriers around the construction area on the right side of the road, indicating that roadwork is in progress, and part of the roadway is likely closed to traffic. Traffic lights and other objects are not present in this scene."
