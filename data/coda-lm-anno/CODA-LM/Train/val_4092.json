A white van and a gray truck are parked on the left side of the road, close to the roadside. These vehicles may unexpectedly start moving or open their doors, which could affect the traffic flow and require the ego vehicle to approach with caution.\n2. A red car is traveling in the opposite direction on the right side of the road, posing a potential risk of head-on or side impact if either vehicle deviates from its lane.\n3. Further ahead on the right side of the street, there is a truck with a green body and a red hood that is also parked. This truck could obstruct visibility or suddenly become a dynamic obstacle if it starts moving.\n4. A three-wheeled motorbike is traveling in the same direction as the ego vehicle, on the right. This type of vehicle can be less stable and unpredictable, so the ego car should keep a safe distance.\n\nTraffic Signs:\nThere are multiple round signs on a post by the roadside that appear to be prohibition or restriction signs. These signs likely convey driving restrictions or cautions that must be followed for safe operation.\n\nTraffic Cones:\nA single green traffic cone is in the middle of the road, directly in the path of the ego vehicle. This cone indicates potential roadwork or hazards ahead, necessitating a lane change or reduced speed to navigate safely.\n\nOther Objects:\nNext to the green cone, there is a dustbin in the middle of the road. The presence of the dustbin near the cone may indicate a temporary work zone or obstacles that could impact road usage.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or barriers present in the image."
