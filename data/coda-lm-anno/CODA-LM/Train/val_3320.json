Due to its large size and the nature of the vehicle, it may affect the general traffic flow and require the autonomous vehicle to either reduce speed or change lanes for safe overtaking.\n\nAdditionally, there is a white and red vertically striped traffic sign with Chinese characters on the right sidewalk. The exact meaning of the sign cannot be determined because of the language, but it might include important information or warnings that the ego car should be prepared to act upon.\n\nThe road is bordered by green metal railings on both sides, serving as a separation between the road and the adjoining sidewalk and properties. This type of barrier restricts the car from leaving the road, making it essential for it to stay within the lane markings, as pulling over is not an option. No vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects are reported in the scene."
