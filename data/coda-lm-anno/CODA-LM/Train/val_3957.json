However, there is a series of orange traffic cones arranged in a line on the right side of the road, occupying part of the lane. These cones indicate a work zone or an area to avoid and suggest that there might be road work ahead or a requirement to merge into the adjacent lane to continue safely. Additionally, there is a stationary tent-like structure on the right side, close to a building. Although it seems unrelated to traffic and is near the roadside, it does not directly impact driving behaviors. Nevertheless, its proximity to the road requires that the driver remains cautious in case of any unexpected movements around that area."

In this case, the cone may be indicating an area of road work or a particular hazard on the road which the ego car should avoid by steering clear, thus affecting how the ego car navigates through this area.",
