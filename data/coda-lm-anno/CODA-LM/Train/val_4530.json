Additionally, there are multiple vehicles visible in the distance, also traveling in the same direction. These vehicles contribute to the overall traffic flow and may influence the ego car's driving speed and lane selection decisions.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a speed limit sign that displays '60'. This sign is crucial as it informs the ego car of the maximum legal speed, and it is necessary for the ego car to adhere to this limit.\n\nFurthermore, orange and white traffic cones are positioned on the right side, delineating the boundary of the driving lane. These cones serve as an indication that there may be a reduction in lane width or ongoing roadwork, and they guide the ego car to remain within the lane boundaries.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
