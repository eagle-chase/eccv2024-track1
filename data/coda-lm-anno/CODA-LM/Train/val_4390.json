Firstly, there is a blue car parked on the right side of the road. This stationary vehicle partially occupies the road space, potentially narrowing the drivable area for the ego car and requiring careful navigation. Secondly, a three-wheeled motorized vehicle is moving ahead towards the ego car while carrying a load. This vehicle might travel at a slower speed and its smaller size could necessitate speed adjustments or a lane change by the ego car to pass safely. Lastly, a detached trailer is parked on the right side of the road. Similar to the parked car, this trailer reduces the usable width of the road, demanding mindful maneuvering or a lane adjustment from the ego car. No other road users, such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects, are present in the image."
