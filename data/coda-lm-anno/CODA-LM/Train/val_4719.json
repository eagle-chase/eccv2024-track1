        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, several key elements are affecting the driving environment:\n\n1. **Traffic Lights**: There is a temporary traffic light present. This light is mounted on a portable structure in the center of the roadway and is currently displaying a green light. The presence of this temporary traffic light is crucial as it governs the flow of traffic, particularly in areas under construction or where standard traffic signals are unavailable. The green light signals that it is safe for the ego car to continue moving forward.\n\n2. **Barriers**: Accompanying the temporary traffic light is a barrier made of wood and metal. This barrier not only supports the traffic light installation but also acts as a physical delineation within the road. It is placed centrally, likely indicating ongoing road works or lane closures. This barrier affects driving behavior by reducing the available road width and requiring more careful navigation to maneuver safely around it.\n\n3. **Other Objects**: Adjacent to the road, there are notable structures such as a tower and overhead power lines. These are permanent installations and generally do not influence driving decisions directly under normal circumstances unless there is an incident like fallen wires or maintenance activities taking place.\n\nOverall, the scene demands attention to temporary installations and modifications to the normal traffic flow, guiding the ego car's driving strategy in response to green traffic signals and navigational adjustments due to barriers."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a traffic light mounted on a pole near the roadside. It plays a crucial role in regulating vehicle movements at intersections or road junctions by displaying different colored signals: red, yellow (amber), and green. In this driving scenario, the ego car must observe the color of the light displayed by this traffic light to determine the appropriate driving action, such as stopping at red, preparing to move or being cautious at yellow, and proceeding with caution when the signal turns green.",
