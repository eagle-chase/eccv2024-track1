It is characterized by its large rotating drum used for mixing cement, which is clearly visible at the back of the vehicle. This truck is commonly found on or near construction sites. In traffic scenarios like this, the presence of a large construction vehicle can influence driving behavior by requiring increased caution and possibly reduced speed from the ego car, as these vehicles tend to make frequent stops and have limited maneuverability.",
