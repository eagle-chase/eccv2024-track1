However, there is a significant presence of traffic management tools that include a traffic light and traffic cones that impact driving behavior. Specifically, a traffic light is visible on the left side of the image emitting a green light, which signals that the ego car is permitted to continue moving forward or to proceed with any maneuvers that are in accordance with other road conditions and signals. Additionally, there are multiple white traffic cones arranged on the right side of the road, partially obstructing one lane. These cones suggest there might be roadwork or other obstructions, indicating that the ego car should reduce speed and possibly prepare to change lanes if necessary."

It's also advisable to keep headlights and taillights on to enhance visibility and signal presence to other road users."
