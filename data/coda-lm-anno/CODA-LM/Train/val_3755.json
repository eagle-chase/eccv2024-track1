This animal's presence near the road is a potential hazard since there is a chance it might unexpectedly run onto the road, thereby posing a risk to both the vehicle's occupants and the animal itself. Additionally, there are street lights positioned along the right side, which serve to enhance visibility on the road. However, these lights do not substantially mitigate the various risks that come with night-time driving. There are no vehicles, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers in the scene."

The presence of an animal on or near the road can pose significant dangers to both the animal and drivers. The ego car should adjust its speed and remain vigilant to avoid a collision. The driver should monitor the animal's movements and be prepared to stop if the animal enters the roadway. It's always crucial to approach animals on the road carefully as they can be unpredictable and may suddenly move across the road.",

Keep headlights and, if necessary, high beams on to improve visibility, but be ready to switch off high beams in case of oncoming traffic to avoid glaring other drivers."
