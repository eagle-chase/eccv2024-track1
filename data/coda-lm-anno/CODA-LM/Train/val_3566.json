Firstly, there is a large truck positioned on the right side, slightly ahead of the ego car, occupying the rightmost lane. The presence of this truck may reduce visibility for the ego car and limits the space available for maneuvering to the right. Additionally, a blue car is located directly in front of the ego car, in the center of the middle lane. This car will influence the ego car's speed and lane choice, necessitating the maintenance of a safe following distance.\n\nApart from the vehicles, there are other objects to be aware of. Some covered parked vehicles and utilities are situated on the right side, with overhead electrical lines stretching across the horizon. Although these objects are not on the road, their proximity to the driving path requires cautious driving to anticipate any potential obstacles or unexpected movements from the areas near the parked vehicles."
