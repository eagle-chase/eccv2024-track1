                "explanation": "The truck's size and lane occupancy require the ego car to maintain a safe following distance or prepare for a lane change. The emissions can reduce visibility and air quality, potentially requiring increased following distance and use of headlights or fog lights."

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there is a large truck positioned on the right side ahead of the autonomous vehicle, which is partially sharing the lane. It is essential for the autonomous vehicle to keep a safe distance behind this truck or to get ready for a lane change maneuver, because the truck's size and its encroachment on the lane could obstruct the vehicle's path. Moreover, there are visible signs of dust or exhaust emissions emerging from the truck. This pollution could lead to a decrease in visibility and a deterioration in the air quality around the ego vehicle, which suggests that a greater following distance might be necessary and that the vehicle might also need to activate its headlights or fog lights to improve visibility. There are no other road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the image that affect driving behavior."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, specifically a cement mixer truck, characterized by its large rotating drum used to mix cement components. Its presence on the road often indicates nearby construction or road work. For the ego car, the size and operational nature of this vehicle suggest that extra caution should be taken while driving near it. There could be potential hazards such as sudden stops, slower moving traffic, or debris from construction materials. The driver should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for unexpected maneuvers by the construction vehicle.",
