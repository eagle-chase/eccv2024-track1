        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several elements that the ego vehicle must consider. Firstly, there is a silver SUV on the right side of the road ahead, facing the same direction as the ego vehicle. It appears to be in motion, indicating that the ego vehicle should maintain a safe following distance. Additionally, a white car is driving parallel to the ego vehicle on the left side, also in the same direction. The ego vehicle should be cautious of potential lane changes from this white car.\n\nAhead, across the intersection, there are several cars and a bus preparing to move or already moving through the intersection in various directions. This situation requires the ego vehicle to observe carefully and be ready to yield, taking into account the right of way.\n\nA cyclist is also present in the scene, moving across the pedestrian crossing from the right to the left side of the image. The ego vehicle is required to yield to the cyclist, who has the right of way, until they have safely crossed.\n\nFurthermore, there is a red traffic light directly ahead, mounted on the other side of the intersection. This red light mandates that the ego vehicle must stop completely before the intersection and wait for the light to turn green before proceeding.\n\nLastly, orange traffic cones are placed on the right side of the image, partially on the road, signaling some road work or lane demarcation. The ego vehicle must avoid the coned-off area, which may necessitate a lane change if the cones are in the vehicle's path.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, barriers, or other objects in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."
