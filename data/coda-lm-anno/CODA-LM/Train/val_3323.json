        "description and explanation": "The traffic image shows the presence of two vehicles. On the left side of the ego vehicle, there's a large orange school bus in motion and partially in view. The proximity and size of the school bus can obscure the driver's view on that side and represent a potential hazard if lane changes are needed. It's crucial to maintain a safe distance due to the bus being a moving vehicle. On the right side of the ego vehicle, there is a white commercial truck moving in a parallel direction and fully in view. Trucks usually have larger blind spots and can make sudden moves, which necessitates keeping a safe following distance and being cautious when overtaking. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects detected in the image."

The presence of this school bus influences driving behavior by indicating that the driver should maintain a cautious speed and be alert for possible stops or turns by the bus, as well as the potential presence of children around the area.",

Continue to monitor the environment for any additional road users or changes, and adjust speed and position accordingly while staying within the current lane."
