        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are two vehicles noted. The first is a black SUV located directly in front of the ego vehicle, distinguished by its illuminated brake lights. This suggests that the SUV is either decelerating or has stopped, thus requiring the ego car to reduce its speed or come to a complete halt to keep a safe distance. The second vehicle is a white van situated to the left of the ego car, which is observable through the rain on the side window. The van is significant even though it is not in the direct path of the ego car; its movements must be carefully watched in case of potential lane shifts or sudden maneuvers, especially because the conditions suggest a wet road surface. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene."

The presence of this car directly ahead requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to stop or adjust speed if the car ahead slows down or stops suddenly.",
