            "description and explanation": "This object is a traffic cone, typically made from a bright orange, flexible plastic material, and it features a reflective strip around its middle to enhance visibility. Traffic cones are commonly used to signal areas of potential hazards or to redirect traffic flow around construction sites, accidents, or other temporary disruptions on roadways. In the context of driving, the presence of this traffic cone suggests that there may be some form of obstruction ahead on the road. Therefore, the ego car should be prepared to slow down, proceed with caution, or potentially change lanes if the roadway is partially blocked by the hazard that the cone is indicating.",
