This pedestrian's proximity to the roadway warrants careful monitoring as they may cross the street or move closer to the traveling lane.\n\nNo traffic signs that affect driving decisions are visible in the immediate scene. This means standard road rules apply, but caution is advised, especially due to nighttime conditions and the presence of a pedestrian.\n\nA traffic light ahead shows a green color, indicating that the ego car can continue moving forward without needing to stop.\n\nTemporary barriers are visible on the right side of the road, enclosing a construction or restricted area. These barriers suggest that a section of the road or adjacent area is closed off, reinforcing the need to remain in the current lane.\n\nLastly, the setting is a well-lit urban area with high-rise buildings and illumination, which might cause light reflections or distractions.
