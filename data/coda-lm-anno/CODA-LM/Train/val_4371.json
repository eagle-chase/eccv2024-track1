Given his closeness to the road and the possibility that he may change direction, the ego car must take into account the safety measures necessary to respond to his potential actions.\n\nAdditionally, there are substantial cable reels situated on the right, just beside the pedestrian's path. Although these objects are stationary and do not block the vehicle's path, they represent potential hazards if they were to be moved or if they inadvertently roll onto the roadway. The ego car must be aware and prepared for such contingencies."
