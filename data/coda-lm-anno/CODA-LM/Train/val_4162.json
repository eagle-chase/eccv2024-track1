Additionally, the scene depicts various heavy construction vehicles, including yellow and orange excavators and a blue truck parked along both sides of the road. These parked vehicles are considered potential hazards as they reduce the available road width and could restrict or limit the maneuvering capabilities of the ego car.\n\nDirectly above the center of the road, there is a prominent rectangular road sign which is likely to contain important information or directions that are pertinent to navigate the area. The presence of this sign indicates that it may have an impact on the driving decisions of the autonomous vehicle.\n\nOn the right side of the road, blue construction barriers are also present. These barriers are partially surrounding the construction zone and the heavy vehicles. They serve as a warning that there is construction or work in progress, signifying that drivers should reduce their speed and exercise increased caution when driving through this area.\n\nThe data does not report the presence of any vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other miscellaneous objects in the image. Therefore, considerations for these elements are not required for the given traffic scenario."

This large, yellow and orange vehicle, equipped with an excavator arm and a loader bucket, is used for various tasks such as digging, earthmoving, and loading materials. The presence of this construction vehicle indicates ongoing or potential roadwork or construction activities in the area. As a result, the ego car should be prepared for possible obstructions or diversions on the road, reduced speed limits, and the presence of workers or other construction vehicles nearby. The ego car may need to reduce speed and exercise increased caution when passing through this section of the road to ensure safety and compliance with traffic regulations.",

This type of crane is commonly used in construction projects for lifting heavy materials or equipment. The presence of such a vehicle on or near the road can indicate ongoing or upcoming construction activities. For the driver of the ego car, this suggests there might be potential obstacles or changes in the usual traffic flow, such as road closures, diversions, or reduced lane widths. Consequently, the driver should be prepared to reduce speed, observe any temporary traffic signs, and yield to construction workers or machinery moving around the site.",
