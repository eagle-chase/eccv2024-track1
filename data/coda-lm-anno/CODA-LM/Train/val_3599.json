        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scenario observed, there are several notable elements. On the right side of the road, slightly ahead of the self-driving car's current position, there is a white sedan parked. The location of this parked car is significant as it reduces the available width for vehicles to drive on and could potentially cause moving cars to merge into the self-driving car's lane. Caution is necessary when approaching this area.\n\nAdditionally, reflective traffic cones have been placed along the center line of the road. These cones serve an important purpose by creating a physical separation between the lanes of opposing traffic. As a result, they provide a clear directive for the vehicles to stay within their respective lanes, guiding safe roadway navigation and maintaining orderly traffic flow.\n\nLastly, there's a roadside stall with a vendor and umbrella situated closely to the parked white sedan, again on the right side of the road. This informal commerce activity presents another layer of complexity. The vendor's presence could attract pedestrians which raises concerns about individuals potentially stepping onto the road. This increases the risk of an unexpected obstruction for the autonomous vehicle and other road users. It would be crucial for the autonomous driving system to monitor this area for pedestrian movement to ensure safety. \n\nOverall, the self-driving car must be vigilant of these factors — the parked sedan, the traffic cones, and the roadside stall — to navigate this environment safely and effectively."
