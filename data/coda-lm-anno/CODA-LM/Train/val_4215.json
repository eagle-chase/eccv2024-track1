Directly in front of the ego car is a concrete mixer truck marked with the number 12.5, equipped with operational construction equipment. This truck may slow down or stop suddenly due to its heavy-duty nature and construction-related operations, necessitating that the ego car maintain an appropriate speed and safety distance. Additionally, a beige van is positioned slightly ahead in the left lane, which is important to monitor for potential sudden lane changes or stops that could impact the ego car's movements. Furthermore, a motorcycle rider is observed on the right side, traversing near the curb. The unpredictable speed and direction changes of motorcycles require heightened awareness and possible adjustments in the ego car's trajectory to ensure safety and avoid collisions."

Overall, drive defensively, focusing on the space around these key road users to ensure safety and smooth navigation through this traffic scenario."
