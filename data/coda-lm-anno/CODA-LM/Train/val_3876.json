However, there is a notable presence of traffic safety equipment with two reflective traffic cones visible. These cones are situated in the middle of the road and appear to either form a partial barrier or to signal a hazard such as a construction site. The placement of these cones requires vehicles to alter their course to navigate around the obstruction. This change in the driving path may necessitate a slight detour or even a merge into an adjacent lane, particularly if the cones are occupying a substantial portion of the road."

It is colored in a highly visible reflective orange hue to ensure it can be seen during nighttime or low-light conditions. In this driving scenario, the presence of this traffic cone might suggest a temporary change in traffic patterns or alert the driver that there are potential hazards or ongoing road work ahead. The driver of the ego car should remain cautious, slow down, and possibly prepare for altered lane paths or unexpected obstacles.",
