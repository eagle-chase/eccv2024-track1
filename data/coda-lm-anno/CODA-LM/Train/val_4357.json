        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are a few notable elements affecting the driving conditions. Firstly, a silver SUV is in the rightmost lane, signaling an intention to change lanes to the left. This action requires careful monitoring as it could disrupt the traffic flow and may require the ego car to alter its speed or change lanes to maintain a safe distance.\n\nAdditionally, there are several vehicles parked on the left side of the road. These vehicles, of various colors and models, are parallel parked and reduce the available lane width. They also pose potential risks as they could conceal hazards such as pedestrians attempting to cross the road or other vehicles that might unexpectedly enter the traffic flow.\n\nFurthermore, traffic signs are present in the middle of the road, near the center line. These portable signs indicate no parking and notify drivers of upcoming road work. The presence of these signs necessitates a reduction in speed and increased vigilance from drivers due to the changes in traffic patterns and the potential for obstructions.\n\nLastly, traffic cones are set up to direct traffic away from the right lane, likely due to barriers or road work. These cones effectively narrow the road and require vehicles, including the ego car, to merge into the left lane, influencing lane selection and potentially leading to traffic congestion.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects reported in this scene that impact driving behavior."
