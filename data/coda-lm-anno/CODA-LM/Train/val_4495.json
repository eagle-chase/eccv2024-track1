It is designed to be highly visible, often made from a bright, reflective material such as orange plastic with reflective tape around it. Traffic cones are commonly used to redirect traffic, mark hazardous areas, or indicate ongoing road work or other temporary changes in the road layout. In this driving scenario, the presence of this cone suggests that there could be potential hazards or changes in the usual traffic patterns ahead. It will influence the ego car to potentially slow down, maneuver carefully around the cone, and be alert for any additional signs or instructions indicating a deviation or special condition on the road.",
