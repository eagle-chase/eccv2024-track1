This truck occupies a significant portion of the lane shared with the ego car, potentially obstructing or reducing the available space for maneuvering. Ahead in the left lane, there is a white van directly in front of the ego vehicle. This van's proximity requires the ego vehicle to monitor its speed and directional changes closely. Additionally, several cars are in the distance in both lanes, moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. These distant cars form part of the traffic flow the ego car must navigate, necessitating attention to speed adjustments and possible lane changes.\n\nFurthermore, there is a traffic light ahead showing green. The green light indicates that vehicles in the ego vehicle's lane and adjacent lanes are allowed to proceed, which influences the ego car's decision to continue moving at or adjusting speed according to the traffic flow."
