A red traffic light is visible above a railroad crossing, signaling the ego car to stop and wait for a train to pass or for the signals to change. On the right side of the road, multiple orange traffic cones are aligned, demarcating the driving path and indicating that the ego car must stay within these lanes, likely due to roadwork or lane closures ahead. Alongside these traffic cones, yellow and black striped barriers provide an additional visual cue to prevent the vehicle from entering a restricted or hazardous area. Additionally, there is a strong glare from headlights directly facing the ego car, which can cause visibility issues and requires the driver to reduce speed and exercise increased caution."
