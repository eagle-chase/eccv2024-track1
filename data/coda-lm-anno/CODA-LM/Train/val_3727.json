It features a large rotating drum used for mixing concrete, which is mounted on the back of the truck. Its presence on the road indicates active construction activity nearby or the transportation of ready-mix concrete to a construction site. For the ego car, this implies potential delays or the need for increased caution while driving near this large vehicle, as these trucks often move slower and may make sudden stops or turns at construction sites.",
