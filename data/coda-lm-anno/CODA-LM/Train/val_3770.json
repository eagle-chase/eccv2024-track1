Specifically, it is a large truck with its cargo bed raised, positioned right in front of the autonomous car. The raised bed of the truck is problematic as it obstructs the view and the passage ahead, making it impossible for the ego car to proceed safely without risk. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects observed in the image that would affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

Future driving behavior should consider maintaining a safe distance from this bus, given its frequent stops and the potential for sudden passenger embarkation or disembarkation, which might result in unexpected pauses in traffic flow.",
