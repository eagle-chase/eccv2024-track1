This large vehicle could block the ego car's view of the road and calling for vigilance, as well as potentially requiring the ego car to slow down or change lanes to keep a safe distance. Additionally, there are cars moving in the opposite direction on the other side of the road. While these vehicles are on a separate carriageway, the ego car still needs to be aware of them in case of unexpected maneuvers which may impact its own trajectory.\n\nPedestrians are also part of the traffic environment, seen at the edge of the road and crossing at the intersection ahead. This demands the ego car to be ready to stop or yield as pedestrians might step onto its path.\n\nThe current state of the traffic light is green for the ego car's direction, giving it the right of way. However, due caution is called for, especially considering the pedestrian crossing activity detected in the intersection zone.\n\nNo traffic signs, cones, barriers, or other objects have been reported in the scene, suggesting that they are not affecting the driving conditions for the ego car at this moment."
