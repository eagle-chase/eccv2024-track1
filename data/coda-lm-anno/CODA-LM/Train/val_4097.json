The sedan is in motion or positioned on the roadway, which implies the possibility of it changing lanes, speeding up or slowing down. As a result, the driving behavior of the ego car should involve maintaining a safe distance, staying alert for any sudden movements from the sedan, and being prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary to avoid a collision or accommodate the sedan's movements.",
