It appears to occupy the majority of the driving lane, and its rear lights are on, indicating that it is active. The size and position of the truck, along with its potential to make sudden stops for unloading materials, poses a significant obstacle. This requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance or consider changing lanes if it is possible and safe to do so.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic light visible above, displaying a red signal for the direction the ego car is headed, and a green light for the cross traffic. The red traffic light requires the ego car to halt at the intersection, ensuring compliance with traffic laws and providing safety for all road users.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "The ego car should come to a complete stop due to the red light at the intersection, maintaining a safe distance from the cement mixer truck in front. The vehicle's size and the load may obscure visibility and unpredictably affect its braking, hence caution should be exercised. Upon green light, assess if the right side lane is free for a possible lane change to safely bypass the truck if it remains stationary."
