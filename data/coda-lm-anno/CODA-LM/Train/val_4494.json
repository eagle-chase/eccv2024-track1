Firstly, there is a white van in the middle lane ahead of the ego car, moving in the same direction. The presence of the van is significant as it may influence the ego car's ability to change lanes or maintain its current speed. Additionally, there is a motorcycle on the right side of the ego car, slightly ahead and sharing the same lane. Due to its smaller size and agility, the motorcycle could affect the ego car's decisions regarding lane usage and speed adjustments.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a parking sign, which suggests that the ego car should be vigilant for vehicles that might stop or pull out in that area. This requires extra caution when the ego car is passing through this zone.\n\nOrange traffic cones are placed on the right edge of the right lane, indicating possible roadwork or hazards. This situation may necessitate a lane change for the ego car to avoid the cones. Concrete barriers are also present on the left side of the road, delineating the roadway boundary and limiting the ego car's ability to move to the left.\n\nLastly, there are billboards situated on the right side next to the apartments. Although they do not directly impact the driving lane, their presence could be a visual distraction, and the ego car needs to maintain focus to avoid being diverted by them.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects affecting the driving behavior of the ego car in this image."
