This vehicle is not currently affecting the driving decisions of the ego car, as it is stationary and not blocking the path of travel.\n\nAdditionally, there are vulnerable road users present, including a dog that is crossing the road at the crosswalk directly in the ego car's path. The dog's presence requires the ego car to yield or stop to ensure the dog's safety. Also in the scene is a motorcyclist, who is crossing the intersection further ahead, moving from left to right in relation to the ego car's direction of travel. The motorcyclist's motion may impact the ego car's ability to proceed through the intersection, subject to their speed and direction.\n\nRegarding traffic lights, there is one in direct view of the ego car, displaying a red light. Consequently, the ego car is required to come to a halt at the intersection to adhere to traffic laws and to maintain safety practices.\n\nNo data has been provided about traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects, which implies that these are either absent from the scene or not relevant to the ego car's immediate driving situation."
