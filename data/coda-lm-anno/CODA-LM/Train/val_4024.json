        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are a couple of vehicles and a vulnerable road user that may affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle. Firstly, directly in front of the ego car, there's a large green cement mixer truck with a red license plate reading '浙FE2332'. The truck's considerable size and position present a potential obstacle as it could block the view ahead and might make unexpected stops due to its operation requirements. Secondly, to the left of the ego vehicle, there's a bus which is only partially visible, displaying some route information and advertising. The bus's behavior could include frequent stops to collect and drop off passengers, necessitating vigilance from the ego car to predict stops and look out for pedestrians crossing. Lastly, on the right-hand side of the scene, there are cyclists moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. Since cyclists can often alter their speed or direction suddenly, it is essential for the ego car to keep a safe distance and speed to prevent any possible incidents. There are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects indicated in the scene that would influence driving behavior."

            "description and explanation": "The object is a large public transit bus, typically designed to carry multiple passengers. It is equipped with large windows and multiple doors, enhancing accessibility and visibility. In an urban driving scenario, buses like this may stop frequently to pick up and drop off passengers, which could cause temporary halts or slowdowns in traffic flow. Drivers in the vicinity, including the ego car, should maintain a safe distance and be prepared to stop or slow down, especially near bus stops.",

Also, stay vigilant of the bus on the left which may decelerate without warning for passenger activity. Additionally, keep an eye on the cyclists to the right, ensuring to not overtake them dangerously while giving them ample space. Consider changing lanes if it is safe to do so to avoid congested traffic around these road users."
