The presence of the cone suggests there may be an ongoing construction, temporary obstruction, or alteration in the usual traffic pattern ahead. The driver of the ego vehicle should reduce speed and stay alert for any directional signs or additional cones that may guide the vehicle through a different traffic path or indicate a closing lane.",
