While it currently poses no immediate threat, it warrants attention in case of any unexpected lane deviations. Additionally, stationary construction vehicles are situated on the right side, but as they are located within a construction site beyond the road's edge, they do not directly impede the ego car's path. \n\nNo vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists are present in the image.\n\nA traffic sign related to construction is partially visible on the right. Though not fully clear, it signifies ongoing construction work, suggesting the need for reduced vehicle speed and increased driver vigilance due to potential changes in the road surface or layout.\n\nThere are no traffic lights displayed in the image.\n\nTraffic cones are in sight in front of the construction site on the road's right side, serving as markers to guide vehicles away from the construction zone, indicating where the car should not drive.\n\nSafety barriers are installed along the right side, delineating the boundary between the construction area and the roadway. These barriers inform the ego car's need to stay at a safe distance to prevent collisions, as they limit the usable width of the road.\n\nLastly, there is an assortment of construction materials and debris near the road on the right. The presence of these materials creates the risk of them encroaching onto the driving path, dictating caution on the part of the ego vehicle to steer clear of any potential obstacles that might pose a hazard."
