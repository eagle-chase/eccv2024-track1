First, a white SUV is ahead of the ego car in the right lane, moving in the same direction. This SUV could influence the ego car's speed and following distance. Additionally, a green bus is stopped at a traffic light in the left lane ahead. This bus may obstruct the view of the intersection, necessitating that the ego car remain prepared for possible movement from the bus once the light changes.\n\nIn terms of vulnerable road users, there is a small black dog crossing the road from right to left in front of the stopped bus. This dog's presence might cause the bus or other vehicles to brake suddenly or swerve, directly impacting traffic flow and safety.\n\nA blue parking sign is located on the right side of the road, indicating a nearby parking area. This could lead drivers to slow down or stop unexpectedly to park, potentially causing traffic disruption.\n\nThe traffic lights for the lane going straight show a green light, signifying that vehicles, including the ego car, can proceed through the intersection. However, they must stay cautious due to the dog crossing and any sudden stops the bus might make.\n\nThis summary covers all the significant road users and traffic elements, conveying their descriptions and the impact they have on the driving behavior of the ego car."
