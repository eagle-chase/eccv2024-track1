This car is moving towards the ego car, which necessitates that the ego car maintain its position within its own lane to prevent a collision. The second vehicle is further ahead, also approaching from the opposite direction, and it has bright headlights. The brightness of these headlights could potentially cause glare, which would reduce the ego car's visibility. As a result, the ego car must proceed with extra caution. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image."
