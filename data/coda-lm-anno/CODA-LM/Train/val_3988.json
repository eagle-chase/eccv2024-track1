The presence and movement of this vehicle significantly influence the ego car's ability to maintain a safe following distance and navigate the lane effectively. Additionally, there are orange and white traffic cones positioned on the left side of the road. These cones mark the beginning of a lane closure, signaling a requirement for the ego car to possibly merge to the right or adjust its lane position accordingly. This adjustment is crucial for maintaining a smooth and safe driving path. Moreover, yellow barriers with blue sections at the bottom are placed on the left side of the road, enclosing an area designated for road works. The presence of these barriers serves as a warning for a construction zone ahead, necessitating reduced speed and increased alertness from the ego car to navigate through this area safely."
