The first is a person on a three-wheeled cycle carrying loads, positioned slightly to the left of the ego car's lane and headed in the same direction. This individual requires specific attention due to the potential slow speed and risk of sudden movements, which could affect the traffic flow and driving decisions. The second road user is another cyclist visible further ahead on the left, also traveling in the same direction as the ego car. Similar to the first, this cyclist may travel at varying speeds or make unexpected maneuvers, thus requiring careful monitoring by the ego car. There are no other vehicles, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the image."

Typically bright orange for visibility, traffic cones are used to mark out lanes, indicate alterations in road paths or to safeguard hazardous zones. In this scenario, the presence of a traffic cone could indicate road works, obstacles, or changes in traffic patterns ahead. The ego car needs to remain alert and possibly prepare to slow down or maneuver to avoid the area marked by the cone, ensuring safety and adherence to road rules.",
