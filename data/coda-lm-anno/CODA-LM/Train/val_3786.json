This vehicle is significant as it dictates the following distance and speed the ego car should maintain to ensure safety. The close proximity necessitates careful speed regulation.\n\nAdditionally, various other cars are present on the left lane, proceeding in the same direction as the ego vehicle. These vehicles affect possible lane change decisions and require monitoring for safe maneuvering and speed adjustment.\n\nAhead, a green traffic light is visible over the top of the SUV. This green light indicates that vehicles in the ego car's lane and adjacent lanes are likely to maintain or increase speed as they have the right of way.\n\nMoreover, red-and-white traffic cones are positioned on the right edge of the road, marking an area of no entry. These cones indicate a boundary that restricts the vehicle from moving too far to the right, guiding the movement within the designated lanes."
