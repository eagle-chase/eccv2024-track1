This truck shows visible signs of wear and features high-visibility markings. Its rear chute is extended, suggesting that it might be in the process of delivering concrete. This setup indicates a possible construction site ahead, presenting an immediate obstacle and potential hazards that may require the ego car to reduce speed.\n\nOn the right side of the image, pedestrians are seen crossing the street in front of a stationary bus, utilizing a crosswalk. As these pedestrians are moving across the street, they are at risk of collision and hold the right of way. Consequently, the ego car must wait until these individuals have safely crossed before it can proceed.\n\nAdditionally, traffic lights are not clearly visible in the image. Given the lack of visibility of traffic light status, the ego car must make its driving decisions based on standard traffic rules, road markings, and the behavior of other road users."

The ego car's path may be constrained due to the working vehicle and the pedestrians, so it should reduce speed and proceed only when it is safe and clear to do so."
