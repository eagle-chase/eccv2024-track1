This indicates that the sedan is either slowing down or has come to a stop. As a result, the ego vehicle should be prepared to slow down or stop to maintain a safe following distance. There are no vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists visible in the image, so no specific action is required concerning these road users at this time. Additionally, there are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present that would affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle. However, reflective markers are visible on the right side of the lane, which likely indicate the edge of the driving lane and serve to guide the ego vehicle in maintaining proper lane discipline."
