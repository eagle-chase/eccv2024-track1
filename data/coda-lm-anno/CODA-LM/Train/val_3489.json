The vehicles include a white van parked on the left side of the road facing the ego vehicle, which reduces the width of the usable road and requires caution while passing. A red truck is also parked on the left, further down the road, facing the ego vehicle; it presents a similar situation to the van by narrowing the driving lane and possibly blocking visibility and maneuver space. Additionally, there is a three-wheeled vehicle traveling ahead on the right side of the ego vehicle, signaling that traffic is ongoing and necessitating vigilance for any sudden changes in its movement pattern.\n\nFurthermore, there is an inanimate object identified as a green waste bin on the left side of the road, situated between the van and the ego vehicle. This object might potentially block the pathway, compelling the ego vehicle to adjust its course slightly to the right to bypass it.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers reported in this scene."

As a larger vehicle, it takes up more space on the road and can influence traffic flow and safety. Its presence could potentially slow down the traffic behind it due to its size and possibly slower speeds, especially in urban or residential areas. The driver of the ego car might need to maintain a greater following distance and prepare for slower movement or sudden stops from this truck.",
