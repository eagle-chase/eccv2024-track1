Due to its significant size and its position, the truck compromises the ego vehicle's ability to maneuver or overtake safely, a condition exacerbated when visibility is low.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a white van parked. This van may obstruct part of the lane and poses a risk of causing a hazardous situation if it suddenly enters the traffic flow.\n\nFurther ahead in the same direction as the ego vehicle is a grey sedan. It is essential for the ego vehicle to maintain a sufficient following distance and stay alert to any unpredictable actions from the sedan, such as abrupt stopping or shifts in direction.\n\nLastly, the view through the vehicle's windshield is impaired by raindrops, leading to low visibility conditions. Consequently, this necessitates a reduction in driving speed and an increased level of vigilance for the surrounding environs and other traffic participants.\n\nThe JSON data does not mention vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers in this image, indicating their absence from the scene."
