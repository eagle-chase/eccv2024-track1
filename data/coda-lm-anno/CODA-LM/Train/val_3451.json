The truck has its tank elevated, connected to the fueling apparatus. The truck's close proximity to the road might pose a potential risk, especially if it initiates movement unexpectedly or if there are additional vehicles attempting to navigate around the refueling area.\n\nAdditionally, there is a worker clad in high-visibility attire who is present next to the tanker truck, engaged in supervising the refueling operation. The worker's presence suggests that there could be unforeseen pedestrian movement into the roadway or potential distractions that could impact vehicles driving past the area.\n\nTo ensure traffic safety near the refueling operations, a series of yellow and black traffic cones have been placed in a line that approaches the refueling zone, clearly defining the separation between the road and the refueling station. These traffic cones serve to direct vehicles away from the refueling activities, maintaining a safe margin and aiding in the flow of traffic along the road.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects have been described for this particular traffic image."
