This vehicleâ€™s large size and position ahead suggest it is either moving slowly or stationary, necessitating the ego vehicle to slow down or prepare for a lane change to overtake safely.\n2. **Blue Pickup Truck**: Parked on the left side of the road, this stationary truck is positioned parallel to the roadway. While it does not immediately affect the ego vehicle's path, vigilance is required in case it moves unexpectedly or if there are pedestrians nearby.\n3. **Red Flatbed Truck**: Located on the right-hand side of the road and facing the opposite direction to the ego vehicle. It becomes relevant if it starts moving into the lane or if the ego vehicle intends to change lanes to the right, as it would limit maneuvering space.\n\n**Barriers:**\n- **Blue-Colored Barriers**: These barriers are on the left side of the road, indicating separation from a construction or restricted area. They suggest potential entry of pedestrians or equipment into the roadway, requiring the ego vehicle to exercise caution.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects present in the image."

The ego vehicle should continue to monitor the environment for any changes that might affect the driving path."
