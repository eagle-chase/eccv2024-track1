These vehicles do not directly affect the ego car's immediate driving decisions as they are on a different roadway level.\n\n2. **Traffic Signs:** There's a directional sign to the right indicating a turn or exit, with additional text that may specify details about the turn or destinations. This sign indicates a route choice that the ego car may need to take depending on the desired destination.\n\n3. **Traffic Lights:** Overhead red traffic lights are visible at what appears to be an intersection or junction. These traffic lights require the ego car to stop if they pertain to its lane and direction of travel.\n\n4. **Barriers:** A barrier or structure is present on the right side of the road, possibly indicating road work or division of road sections. This barrier may narrow the lane or indicate a hazard area which the ego car should be aware of and potentially avoid by changing lanes if necessary."

Additionally, the ego car should adjust its speed to avoid glare from oncoming headlights or overhead lights affecting the driver's visibility."
