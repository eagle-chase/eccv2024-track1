        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several road users and objects that influence driving behavior:\n\n1. There's a large orange maintenance truck in the right-hand lane with visible warning signs and flashing lights. The truck displays a 'Slow down' sign in Chinese and a speed limit of 20 km/h, suggesting that there is ongoing road work. Drivers must consequently reduce speed and proceed with caution due to these indicators.\n\n2. A cyclist, wearing a high-visibility jacket, is found riding along the right edge of the road, which does not have a marked bike lane. The proximity of the cyclist to the driving lane requires the ego vehicle to be vigilant and prepared to react to any sudden moves by the cyclist.\n\n3. Overhead directional and informational road signage is present, signaling upcoming curves and lane merges. These signs are essential for the driver to anticipate changes in the road layout and adjust the vehicle's lane position and speed accordingly.\n\n4. Traffic lights are observed with a green light for the driving lanes. Although the green light means the vehicle can proceed, the driver must stay attentive to the roadwork and the presence of other road users.\n\n5. Finally, a series of orange traffic cones are placed in a line, marking the boundary of the maintenance area in the right lane. These cones serve to direct traffic, indicating that the ego car should use the left lane and keep clear of the maintenance work being performed in the right lane.\n\nThere are no barriers or other objects indicated in the traffic image, so there is no action or attention required by the ego vehicle concerning these categories."
