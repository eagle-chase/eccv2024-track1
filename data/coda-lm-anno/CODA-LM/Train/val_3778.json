These lights are situated above the roadway on both sides before the intersection. The presence of the red lights is critical as they command the ego car to stop, ensuring it does not run the red light and risk causing an accident.\n\nAdditionally, there are two yellow and black striped traffic cones positioned in the center of the road, ahead of the ego car. These cones likely indicate a hazardous area or road work, requiring the ego car to navigate carefully and possibly adjust its speed to maintain safety.\n\nFurthermore, metal barriers are installed on the right side of the road, running parallel to it. These barriers are presumably there to protect a certain area or to prevent access. It is important for the ego car to keep a safe distance from these barriers to avoid any collisions.\n\nNo other vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, or other objects are present in the image."
