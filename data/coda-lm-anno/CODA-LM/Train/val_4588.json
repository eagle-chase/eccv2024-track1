Directly ahead on the road, there is a large tanker truck carrying hazardous material signs, which suggests the transport of potentially dangerous substances. Due to its size and the nature of its cargo, the truck could affect stopping distances and maneuverability, necessitating special caution from the ego car.\n\nAdditionally, a blue truck is visible ahead and to the left of the ego car, traveling in the same direction. Although smaller than the tanker, this truck occupies another lane and influences the available lanes for the ego car's navigation and potential lane changes.\n\nOn the right side of the ego car's lane, there is a series of red traffic cones, indicating potential hazards or roadworks. These cones may require the ego car to slow down or switch lanes if they constrict lane width or signal other hazards.\n\nFurthermore, there is green fencing along the right side of the road, partially obscuring the base of a highway structure. The barriers serve to delineate construction or controlled areas, limiting access and ensuring that passing vehicles maintain a safe distance to avoid collisions with the fence or anything that might be protected by it.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

The tanker is identified by its cylindrical shape and the markings indicating possibly hazardous contents. Such vehicles require careful monitoring when driving nearby due to their large blind spots and the potentially dangerous nature of their cargo. The future driving behavior of the ego car should involve maintaining a safe distance from this truck to avoid collision risks and to have sufficient time for reactive maneuvers if the truck changes lanes or stops suddenly.",

Due to the presence of traffic cones, staying alert for potential shifts in traffic flow or lane constrictions is advised. Monitoring the barriers on the right is also critical to safely navigate through this section."
