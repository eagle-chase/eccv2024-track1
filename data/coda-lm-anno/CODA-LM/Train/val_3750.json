Due to the truck's size and lane occupancy, overtaking options are limited, and a maintained distance is required to react to any sudden stops or changes in the truck's speed.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a yellow diamond-shaped road sign indicating a pedestrian crossing ahead. This sign warns the driver of potential pedestrian activity, necessitating increased alertness and readiness to stop.\n\nFurther ahead, beyond the truck, a green traffic light is visible, indicating that the flow of traffic is currently permitted. The green light signals that the road ahead is clear, allowing continued movement. However, the driver must remain aware as the situation can change as the ego car approaches the intersection.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image."
