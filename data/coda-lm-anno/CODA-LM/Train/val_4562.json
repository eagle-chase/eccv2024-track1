        "description and explanation": "The image depicts two critical vehicles: a yellow flatbed truck is on the left side of the road, partially occupying the lane and carrying a bulky, heavy crane. This truck is a significant factor as it reduces the available lane width and may start moving or maneuver suddenly due to potential ongoing operations or loading/unloading activities. Additionally, a red truck is detected ahead in the right lane, carrying a load that appears loosely covered and potentially hazardous. This truck's positioning and state could influence traffic flow and necessitate increased safety distances due to the risk of items falling off."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle equipped with a crane arm. The crane apparatus on the back suggests the vehicle is used for lifting heavy materials or equipment at a construction site. Its presence in the vicinity indicates ongoing construction work, which may lead the ego car to anticipate possible obstructions, slow-moving traffic, or temporary traffic signals ahead. The ego car may need to reduce speed and increase alertness for workers and other unpredictable movements around this area.",

Additionally, it should be prepared to stop or maneuver around the flatbed truck if it starts moving or if part of the load shifts or extends into the driving lane. Caution should be exercised to account for the debris on the road, and continuous monitoring of the road ahead is necessary to react to any unforeseen movements or stops from the ahead vehicle."
