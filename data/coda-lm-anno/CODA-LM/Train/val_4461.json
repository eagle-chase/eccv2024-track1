        "description and explanation": "In the scene, there's a concrete mixer truck directly ahead of the ego car in the same lane, slightly skewed to the right, which controls the following distance and speed of our car and may block the view of the road ahead due to its large size. In the left adjacent lane and ahead of the ego car, there's a white sedan whose presence is important to note as it could affect the ego car's decisions on lane changes or merging. Further ahead of the white sedan, several cars with illuminated brake lights suggest traffic congestion that will likely affect the ego car's speed and lane choice. Additionally, in the right adjacent lane, moving ahead of the ego car, there's a small vehicle with a yellow top, which could be a rickshaw or auto-rickshaw, and its slower speed and unpredictable dynamics are factors to consider during lane changes or overtaking.\n\nNo other road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists, or traffic lights, cones, barriers, and miscellaneous objects are present. However, there is a traffic sign indicating a speed limit of 60 on the right side of the road, instructing the ego car to maintain its speed within this legal limit."
