This parked vehicle narrows the usable roadway for the ego car and may potentially open doors or start moving. Additionally, a motorcyclist is riding in the center of the rightmost lane, heading away from the ego car. This motorcyclist is a dynamic and vulnerable road user who requires additional space and attention from the ego car.\n\nMoreover, there are orange traffic cones on the right side of the road, near the parked white SUV. These traffic cones indicate a potential hazard or road work, which could affect the lane the ego car might want to use.\n\nA yellow safety barrier is present on the pedestrian sidewalk to the right of the ego car. The barrier is placed to protect a potential work zone or hazard on the sidewalk and should not directly affect the ego car. However, being aware of it is good in case pedestrians are diverting onto the road.\n\nLastly, there is a hand-pulled cart with various items on the sidewalk to the right of the ego car.
