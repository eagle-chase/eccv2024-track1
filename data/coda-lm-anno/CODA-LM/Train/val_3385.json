        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several road users and signs that the ego car must consider. Firstly, there is a large yellow construction machinery directly in front of the ego car, occupying the central part of the lane and moving in the same direction. The presence of this machinery requires the ego car to possibly slow down or change lanes due to its size, slow speed, and the way it obstructs the view of the road ahead and other road users.\n\nAdditionally, a white sedan is located to the left of the ego car, in the adjacent lane and slightly ahead, also moving in the same direction. The proximity of the sedan to the ego car means that the ego car should maintain a safe distance and be cautious of any lateral movements the sedan might make.\n\nAhead of the white sedan, in the left lane, there is a grey van that is straddling the lane divider, with its right side closer to the ego car. The van appears to be either merging into the left turning lane or staying in the straight lane. The ego car needs to be prepared for potential lane-changing conflicts and may need to adjust its speed or change lanes to avoid any issues.\n\nOn the right side of the ego car, there is a group of pedestrians on the zebra crossing. The ego car is required to yield to these pedestrians, as they have the right of way, and the car must be ready to stop to allow them to cross safely.\n\nLastly, there are directional signs installed on the top right, which indicate the directions for a left turn and straight ahead, along with the distances to these turns. These signs are important for the ego car to note as they provide information about upcoming intersections, and the car should be ready for other vehicles that may make lane changes to follow these directions.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
