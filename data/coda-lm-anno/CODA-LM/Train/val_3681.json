A white car is visible in the adjacent lane to the right, slightly ahead of the ego vehicle, requiring monitoring in case of lane changes. Additionally, a motorcyclist is riding in the same lane as the ego vehicle, slightly ahead and to the right, necessitating caution due to their vulnerability and impact on the ego vehicle's speed and lane choice.\n\nA worker wearing a yellow helmet and high visibility jacket is standing on the road next to the cones and sweeping. The worker's presence signals potential roadwork, requiring the ego vehicle to slow down and proceed cautiously.\n\nThere are orange traffic cones placed on the road next to the worker, partially blocking the lane. These cones indicate a construction zone or temporary obstruction, which may require the ego vehicle to change lanes or reduce speed.\n\nBlue metal barriers are visible on the side of the road, separating the road from the pedestrian walkway.
