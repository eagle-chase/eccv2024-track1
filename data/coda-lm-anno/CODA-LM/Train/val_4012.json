This stationary vehicle may pose risks of sudden obstruction if someone attempts to move it or if parts fall onto the driving path. Additionally, there is a pedestrian, likely an adult male, walking on the road on the right side, who is wearing dark clothing that has minimal light reflection. The pedestrian's position and non-reflective clothing increase the risk of an accident, especially under low-light conditions.
