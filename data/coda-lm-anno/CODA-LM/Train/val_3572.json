There are multiple parked vehicles on either side of the road, including a red car, a white van, and various other cars and scooters, all occupying roadside parking spaces. These parked vehicles reduce the available width of the drivable roadway and could potentially open doors into the pathway of the ego vehicle, requiring cautious driving. Additionally, a green car is traveling in the same direction as the ego car on the left, and its position and movement could influence the ego car's driving strategy, especially if it changes lanes or adjusts speed.\n\nIn terms of vulnerable road users, there is a cyclist moving parallel to the ego car on the right, relatively close to moving traffic. Cyclists can alter their path or speed unexpectedly, necessitating increased vigilance and readiness to react from the ego car. Several pedestrians are also seen walking along the sidewalks and might potentially cross the road. These pedestrians pose a risk and require the ego car to be prepared to stop or slow down.\n\nLastly, an orange trash bin is placed on the curb on the right side. The location of the trash bin is close to the driving lane and could obstruct the view or movement, especially on narrow roads. No traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are depicted in the image."
