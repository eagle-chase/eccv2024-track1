Additionally, on the right side, a pedestrian is spotted near a brightly lit shop, adjacent to where motorbikes are parked. This calls for the ego vehicle to lower its speed and heighten its vigilance as the pedestrian could step onto the road, posing a collision risk. Furthermore, the presence of several parked bicycles and motorbikes on both sides of the road is noted, which reduces the available road width for navigation and may hide other road users, such as pedestrians, thus complicating driving decisions. The summarized traffic image does not include any traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers."

In this scenario, the presence of a tricycle on the roadside necessitates caution from the ego car. The driver should be aware of the possibility of someone approaching the tricycle to either use or move it. It is crucial to monitor such vehicles as their unexpected movement could affect the path of the ego car.",

Similar to the tricycle, the bicycle being parked near the driving lane suggests that there might be individuals nearby. The occurrence of a potentially sudden movement of the bicycle onto the road or individuals entering the street to access the bicycle calls for heightened vigilance. The driver of the ego car should prepare to slow down or stop if the bicycle or its user suddenly enters the driving lane.",

Using low-beam headlights and maintaining a wider-than-usual berth around parked vehicles is advisable to safely navigate through this environment."
