This vehicle's size and position might obstruct the view and reduce maneuverability, potentially leading to difficult driving conditions as construction vehicles are known for making unexpected movements or coming to sudden stops. Additionally, there are blue and white traffic barriers on the right side, demarcating the lane boundaries. These barriers serve to define the drivable area of the road, restricting the ego vehicle from moving into the space on the right of its current lane. Other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, and other objects are not present in this traffic scene."

The presence of this type of vehicle in traffic can influence the driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating increased caution and readiness to adjust speed.
