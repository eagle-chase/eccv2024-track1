An orange van is positioned on the right side of the ego car and is partially merging into the ego car's lane. This orange van could potentially cause a side collision if the ego car does not slow down or change lanes.\n2. A truck, loaded with cargo, is ahead in the same lane as the ego car. This truck could create an obstruction or necessitate sudden braking if it decides to make a stop or turn.\n\nThere are two traffic signs:\n1. A directional sign overhead indicates a right turn ahead. This sign advises that the ego car needs to prepare for potential lane changes from vehicles aiming to turn right.\n2. A no parking sign overhead ensures that the ego car does not stop or park in the roadway, thereby maintaining the flow of traffic.\n\nTraffic cones are present around a work area on the left side of the road. These cones mark the work area, which may cause distractions or obstacles, requiring the ego car to maintain focus and potentially shift lanes to the right.\n\nThere are guardrails on both sides of the road. These barriers confine the road space, necessitating the ego car to stay within the lane and avoid any risks of collision with the barriers.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects were detected in the image."
