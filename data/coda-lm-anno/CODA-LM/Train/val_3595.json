This vehicle's position and speed could influence lane change decisions and speed control for the ego car. Additionally, a speed limit sign indicates '80' with a '40' sign below it, possibly suggesting a lower speed limit ahead or a conditional speed limit. The ego car must adjust its speed accordingly to comply with traffic regulations. On the right side of the road, a continuous green barrier separates the roadway from other areas, indicating that overtaking or turning right may be restricted. Red circular objects are also positioned on the side of the road, potentially indicating road work or a hazard ahead, which necessitates caution and readiness to react to unexpected obstacles for the ego car."
