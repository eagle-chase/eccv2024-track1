            "description and explanation": "The object identified is a truck, visible primarily from its rear profile. The truck, heavily illuminated by the headlights of the ego car, shows characteristics typical of a commercial heavy vehicle used for transporting goods. It is essential in this scenario as it directly influences the ego car's driving behavior. Given the trucks position, occupying the full width of the designated lane, the ego car would likely need to maintain a safe following distance and possibly prepare to slow down or stop, depending on the truck's movements. This ensures the safety not only of the driver but also prevents any potential accidents from abrupt stops or reduced visibility conditions.",

Turn on high beams if necessary to improve visibility and watch for any signs of redirection or instruction. If there is an opportunity to safely pass the truck, proceed with caution, ensuring no oncoming traffic from the opposite direction and that it is legal and safe to pass."
