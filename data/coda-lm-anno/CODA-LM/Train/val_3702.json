This indicates that there might be traffic congestion or a stoppage, which would require the ego car to adjust its speed and maintain a greater distance for safe braking.\n\nAdditionally, a 'No Entry' sign is present on the right side of the road above the guard booth, signaling that entry into certain areas is restricted. This information is essential for the ego car's route planning and compliance with traffic regulations.\n\nFurthermore, reflective road studs can be seen along the lanes, which are particularly visible due to the wet road conditions. These studs are important for lane identification and help the ego car to stay aligned within its lane, especially during nighttime or in adverse weather conditions."
