This situation suggests that there is congestion or a potential queue forming, which means that the driver of the autonomous vehicle should remain cautious and be prepared to stop if necessary.\n\nAdditionally, there are garbage bins placed close to the roadside, encroaching slightly onto the street near the right edge of the image. These bins could present a hazard, particularly if they are not fully visible to drivers in low-light conditions. As a result, an autonomous vehicle should maintain careful navigation around this area and remain vigilant for any possible obstructions that the bins might cause."
