        "description and explanation": "The scene under observation presents a solitary vehicle identified in the data; it is a stationary car parked on the right side of the road, distinguishable by the glow of its rear lights. This car poses a potential hazard for the autonomous vehicle as the driver could unexpectedly maneuver into the traffic flow or if obscured by low light conditions, there may be other road users near the vehicle that are not currently visible. Due to the presence of this vehicle, the autonomous driving system would need to remain alert for any sudden changes in the stationary car's status or uncover hidden road users that might surface into the line of sight. All other categories, such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects, have been reported as empty, indicating their absence from the traffic image and hence do not influence the driving behavior in the current context."
