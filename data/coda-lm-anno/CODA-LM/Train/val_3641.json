It is encountered by the ego car on a nighttime street, indicated by its large size and typical rectangular container structure. The truck features visible identification numbers and safety reflective stripes, which enhance visibility and safety during night driving. The presence of this truck in front of the ego car affects the driving behavior by potentially limiting the ego car's speed and maneuverability. The ego car must maintain a safe following distance and prepare for slower reaction times due to the truck's larger blind spots and potential for sudden stops or turns.",

If the truck's brake lights come on or hazards are used, the ego car should prepare to stop or slow. The absence of other road users and signs indicates that there is no immediate action required aside from following the truck. However, the ego vehicle should remain vigilant for any changes in the road conditions or signals from the truck indicating a possible turn or stop."
