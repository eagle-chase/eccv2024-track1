Its presence takes up a significant portion of the lane and may make unpredictable movements or cause delays in traffic flow.\n   - **White Sedan**: This car is traveling ahead in the same lane, positioned on the right side of the construction truck. It appears to be maneuvering around or keeping a cautious distance from the truck. The behaviors of the sedan might influence the ego car's options for lane changes or speed adjustments.\n\n2. **Traffic Lights**:\n   - **Covered Traffic Light**: A traffic light is positioned above the roadway but is currently not visible under the rear structure of the truck. This obscured state could delay reaction times to changes in traffic light status, both for the ego car and others on the road.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in this scene."

It is large, robust, and equipped with various mechanisms which can include mixers or dumpers, indicating its role in transporting building materials or aiding in construction tasks. Given its presence and implied operation ahead, the ego car must maintain a safe distance and be prepared for potential slow-downs or stops in traffic flow. This ensures safety and compliance with traffic regulations around construction sites.",
