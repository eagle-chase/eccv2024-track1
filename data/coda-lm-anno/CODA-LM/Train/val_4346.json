Firstly, there is a large cement mixer truck on the left side of the ego car, slightly ahead and occupying the adjacent lane. The size of the truck and its potential slow speed due to a heavy load can affect the flow of traffic, necessitating that the ego car maintains a safe following distance or considers changing lanes if the truck's movement hinders the smooth flow of traffic.\n\nFurther ahead of the cement mixer truck, a white sedan is traveling in the same direction. The presence of this sedan indicates a normal flow of traffic in that lane, and it serves as a reference for the ego car to adjust its speed and maintain a safe distance.\n\nOn the sidewalk to the right, there are pedestrians, including an adult and a child, who are moving parallel to the road. Although they are not on the road, their proximity poses a potential risk of unexpected entry onto the roadway, which requires the ego car to remain vigilant.\n\nAdditionally, yellow temporary traffic barriers are installed along the median strip, separating the directions of traffic flow. These barriers suggest that there may be road work or lane reductions, influencing traffic patterns and necessitating cautious driving from the ego car.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the image that impact the driving behavior of the ego car."
