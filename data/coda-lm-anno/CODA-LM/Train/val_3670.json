This truck may potentially slow down or stop to maneuver, impacting the driving path and speed of the ego car.\n  - A red truck is visible in the opposite lane, moving towards the ego vehicle. This oncoming truck requires careful monitoring in case it makes unexpected turns or stops.\n  - Additionally, a grey cement mixer truck is partially visible, trailing the white and red cement mixer truck ahead. Its positioning influences overtaking decisions and demands that the ego car maintains a safe following distance.\n\n- **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n  - A cyclist is on the right-hand side of the road, moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. The presence of the cyclist necessitates that the ego car slows down and ensures a safe passing distance.\n\n- **Traffic Signs**:\n  - Multiple 'No Entry' signs are visible on a barricaded area to the right side of the road. These signs indicate restrictions in road use, influencing the permissible driving paths for the ego car.\n\n- **Barriers**:\n  - Traffic barricades are seen alongside the 'No Entry' signs to the right, blocking a section of the roadside. These barricades restrict access and narrow the usable lane, requiring the ego car to adjust its lateral position."
