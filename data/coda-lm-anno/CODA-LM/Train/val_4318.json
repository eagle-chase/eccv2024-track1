Firstly, a large white truck is positioned on the left side of the image, partially crossing the intersection. It may be going straight or preparing to turn right. The presence of this truck could hinder the ego car's ability to move through the intersection, as it might block the view of traffic signals or other road users.\n\nOn the right side of the road, a red forklift carrying a load appears to be ready to enter or cross the intersection. This forklift is a potential hazard because its path could cross with that of the ego car, requiring the driver to monitor it closely and be prepared to yield.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there is a no parking sign on the right side, ahead of the intersection, which informs drivers of parking regulations that could affect road congestion and navigation. Additionally, there is a partially visible circular sign, likely prohibitory, located just behind the traffic lights. Understanding this sign is crucial for adhering to the driving rules at this intersection.\n\nThe traffic lights in the image show red for vehicles in lanes parallel to the ego car's lane, indicating that the ego car must stop and wait for the green signal before proceeding.\n\nConcrete barriers are also present on the right side of the road, marking the boundary of a road construction zone. These barriers suggest that there may be road works, necessitating a reduction in speed and heightened vigilance.\n\nLastly, there is a parked bicycle next to the barriers on the right side of the road. While it is not currently an obstacle, it could become a sudden hazard if someone decides to use it, so the ego car should stay alert to this possibility.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, or other categories of objects mentioned in the JSON data that need to be considered in this summary."
