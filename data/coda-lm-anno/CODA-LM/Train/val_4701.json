The traffic signs include a \"No entry\" sign for vehicles on the right side of the road, adjacent to a checkpoint or booth, with a speed limit sign indicating '10' below it. These signs suggest that vehicles are not permitted to enter the area past the checkpoint and must adhere to a speed limit of 10 km/h, indicating restricted access and the necessity for cautious driving.\n\nAdditionally, there is a yellow and black striped barrier arm in a raised position to the right side, in front of the checkpoint or booth. The raised barrier arm implies that access may be controlled, and vehicles could be required to stop and possibly obtain permission to proceed.\n\nLastly, there is a person in protective clothing, who appears to be a security guard, standing by the barrier arm at the checkpoint. The presence of this person indicates that manual intervention might be necessary for entry, and vehicles may need to halt and engage with the checkpoint personnel."

In this scenario, the pedestrian's presence close to the roadway indicates a potential crossing situation.

This precaution is crucial in areas where pedestrians might appear suddenly, and it directly affects driving speed and attention focus.",
