This sign may contain crucial details about detours, road closures, or directions that the ego car needs to follow for safe navigation.\n\nMetal barriers and construction fencing are present around the construction area under the bridge. These barriers indicate that certain areas are closed off due to construction, which means the ego car might need to avoid specific lanes or follow detour signs, impacting its navigation path.\n\nVarious debris and construction materials are scattered around the construction site.
