This large vehicle may obstruct the view of the ego car, necessitating cautious driving around it.\n\nOn the right side of the road, a pedestrian is walking along, facing away from the ego car. The pedestrian's proximity to the driving lane means they might step onto the road, requiring the driver to carefully monitor and be ready to stop if needed.\n\nThere is a blue directional sign on the left side of the road, indicating multiple destinations and lane directions. This sign provides critical information about lane usage and upcoming intersections, which could influence the ego car's lane choices and turning decisions.\n\nAdditionally, a no entry sign for trucks is present on the right side of the road. This sign informs that trucks are not allowed to enter a specific road, affecting the route choice if the ego car is a truck or if there are trucks ahead.\n\nNo traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in this scene."
