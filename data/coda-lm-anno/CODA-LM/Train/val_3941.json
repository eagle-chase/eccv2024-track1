Its presence is critical for maintaining a safe lateral distance from our vehicle and to be alert to any unexpected movements the truck might make.\n\nAbove, there are traffic lights displaying red for the lanes moving straight and green for the turning lane to the right. This indicates that while our vehicle must come to a stop if continuing straight ahead, it has the right of way to proceed if choosing to turn right.\n\nAdditionally, a series of orange and white traffic cones are aligned between lanes, signaling lane separation and indicating that there may be a merging of lanes or construction work upcoming. These cones are important in guiding the vehicle to keep within the lane limits and to be aware of potential alterations in the usual traffic pattern.\n\nOn the left side of the road, there are green barriers, creating a divide between the opposite sides of the highway or the oncoming traffic lanes. These barriers serve the purpose of preventing any possibility of the vehicle crossing into the oncoming traffic and ensure the direction of the traffic flows correctly.\n\nThese are all the notable road users and elements affecting the driving behavior and decision-making of the autonomous vehicle in the current scenario."
