This area is designated for caution, requiring vehicles to possibly merge to the left or decelerate to safely navigate past the obstruction, implying a temporary reduction in the available driving lane.\n\nAlong the curb on the right side, there are permanent fence-like barriers which clearly demarcate the road boundary from the adjacent properties. These barriers reinforce that there is no immediate access or crossing points along that stretch of the road, signaling the drivers to stay within the marked driving lanes."
