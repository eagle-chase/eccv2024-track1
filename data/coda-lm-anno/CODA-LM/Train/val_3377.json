The first is a red truck on the opposite lane, executing a left turn and partially blocking the intersection. This truck impacts the ego car's ability to safely cross the intersection, as it may block both the view and the path. The second vehicle is a white car ahead and to the right of the ego car in the same lane, influencing the speed and following distance the ego car must maintain.\n\nAdditionally, there is a green traffic light above the red truck on the opposite lane, indicating that the ego car is allowed to proceed. However, caution is advised due to the positioning of the red truck. Other potential road users such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, and miscellaneous objects are not present in the image."
