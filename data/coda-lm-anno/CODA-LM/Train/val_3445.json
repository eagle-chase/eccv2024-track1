        "description and explanation": "The traffic image presents two categories of road users. \n\nFirstly, there is a large construction vehicle that is stationary and situated on the left side of the image. The vehicle's positioning and some of its components extend into the lane of the ego vehicle. This suggests there might be ongoing work on the road or an obstruction, requiring the ego vehicle to either change lanes or slow down to safely navigate around it.\n\nSecondly, the image shows several cars ahead in the same lane as the ego vehicle, all moving in the same direction. These vehicles are at varying distances from the ego vehicle. This setup will influence how the ego vehicle adjusts its speed and decides on an appropriate following distance, taking into account the flow of traffic and the distances between vehicles.\n\nNo other road users, including vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects, are depicted in this image, which limits the factors the ego vehicle needs to consider in this scenario."

            "description and explanation": "This image features a construction vehicle identified as a cement mixer. It is characterized by a large rotating drum used to mix cement components, which is visually evident and partially covers the vehicle's cabin. The presence of such a vehicle indicates ongoing construction activities nearby, suggesting possible disruptions or slow-moving traffic ahead. As a result, the ego vehicle should prepare to potentially adjust speed or route, maintain increased distance for safety, and stay alert for sudden stops or merging construction traffic.",

Be prepared to reduce speed and potentially change lanes if the construction vehicle is obstructing the ego vehicle's current lane. Monitor the vehicles ahead for any sudden braking or lane changes that may indicate further obstructions or road works ahead. Maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle in front to allow for reaction time should the traffic flow be affected by the road conditions or construction activity."
