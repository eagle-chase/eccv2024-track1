A bright green cement mixer truck is directly in front of the ego car, occupying the full width of the lane and featuring a reflective warning pattern at the rear. This truck is significant due to its size and typically slow speed, blocking the ego car's lane and necessitating either a reduction in speed or a lane change.\n\n2. A red flatbed truck is positioned on the left side of the cement mixer, slightly ahead in a parallel lane, possibly carrying construction material. The proximity and parallel movement of this truck could influence the ego car's decision to change lanes, and the cargo may shift, posing a risk.\n\n3. A dark red sedan is situated on the left, beside the ego car, in a neighboring lane. This sedan's position indicates it is a moving vehicle that the ego car should be mindful of when considering a lane change.\n\n4. A light gold SUV is on the right side, proceeding in the same direction as the ego car and positioned slightly ahead. This SUV's position and trajectory should be monitored, especially if the ego car is considering a lane change to the right.\n\n5. An orange forklift is to the right of the scene, stationed in front of a building and not currently interacting with the road. Although it does not directly impact the road, the presence of the forklift suggests nearby construction activity, which sometimes leads to unexpected entries onto the road or the presence of construction workers.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects noted in the scene."
