        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are two vehicles that are particularly relevant to the ego vehicle's driving decisions. The first is a white van positioned on the right side, occupying the lane next to the ego vehicle. It is important for the ego vehicle to be aware of this van before attempting any lane changes or maneuvers and to ensure a safe distance is maintained to prevent any accidents.\n\nThe second vehicle is a van adorned with red and white decals and QR codes, situated directly ahead of the ego vehicle and slightly obscured from full view within the same lane. This vehicle's behavior is important to monitor as it could potentially slow down, come to a stop, or execute turns without much warning. Consequently, the ego vehicle must maintain a safe following distance and stay alert to react promptly to the leading van's actions. \n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, cones, barriers, or other objects in the image that require immediate consideration for the ego vehicle's current driving strategy."
