The presence of these vehicles limits the available road space for driving and raises the concern that pedestrians might be hidden from view when stepping onto the roadway.\n\nAdditionally, there are bicycles and scooters parked on the side of the road amongst the parked cars. These objects pose a risk as they could fall into the vehicle's path, causing obstructions or hazards. They also have the potential to conceal a pedestrian or an animal from the driver's view, which would necessitate cautious driving near these objects to prevent accidents."
