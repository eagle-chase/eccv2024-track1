The truck's brake lights are on, suggesting that it is either slowing down or coming to a stop. Consequently, the ego vehicle must reduce speed and prepare to stop or consider changing lanes as the truck is blocking the path and stopping.\n\nOverhead, there are directional signs indicating lanes for either going straight or turning. The ego vehicle should take note of these signs to select the correct lane for its intended route.\n\nAdditionally, a pedestrian is visible on the road's shoulder, near parked cars on the right side. The ego vehicle should monitor the pedestrian closely to ensure that they do not step into the roadway unexpectedly."

This vehicle is significant in a road scenario because its slow operating speed and frequent stops at construction sites can affect the flow of traffic. The ego vehicle must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential sudden stops or slow movement from this vehicle. Additionally, the oversized nature of the truck requires other vehicles to be cautious when overtaking or navigating close by.",
