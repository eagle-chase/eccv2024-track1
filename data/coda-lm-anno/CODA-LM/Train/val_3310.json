A large, green construction vehicle is parked on the right side of the road close to the curb. This parked vehicle affects the ego car's driving behavior as it requires the ego car to keep a safe distance while maneuvering past the vehicle in order to avoid potential collisions.\n\n2. In the distance ahead, there is a truck moving in the same direction as the ego car. The presence of this truck necessitates that the ego car remains vigilant about its own speed and positioning while ensuring a safe following distance.\n\nThe traffic image does not feature any vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects that would affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
