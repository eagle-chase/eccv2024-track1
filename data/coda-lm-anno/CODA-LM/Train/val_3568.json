The presence of this truck is significant as it could affect the driving behavior due to its size, potentially slow movement, and the possibility of sudden stops or turns given its function, which obscures part of the forward view.\n\nAdditionally, multiple pedestrians and cyclists are visible in and around the pedestrian crossing immediately to the right of the intersection. These vulnerable road users could suddenly cross the street, which requires the ego car to be prepared to stop or yield at the pedestrian crossing to ensure their safety.\n\nFurthermore, the traffic lights at the intersection are showing both a red and a green light. This situation is particularly important because it is unclear which light controls the lane the ego car is in. Therefore, it is crucial for the ego car to approach the intersection with caution to determine the appropriate response and ensure compliance with the traffic signals.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
