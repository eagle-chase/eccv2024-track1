On the left side of the image, there is a line of cars displaying their red tail lights, either moving slowly or being stopped, indicating potential congestion ahead that may necessitate the ego car to decelerate and prepare for stopping. On the right, we note a vehicle parked by the curb, its hazards or some form of reflection making it clear that it is stationary. The parked vehicle reduces the available driving space, and thus the ego car must maneuver carefully around it.\n\nA pedestrian is also present on the right, walking away from the roadway and moving in the same direction as the traffic. The ego car must keep an eye on this pedestrian in case they make an unexpected move towards the road. Additionally, a warning sign has been spotted in the distance on the left, pointing towards a possible pedestrian crossing or another type of hazard ahead; as a result, the ego car should increase its awareness for pedestrians and prepare for any potential dangers.\n\nMoreover, bollards have been installed along the right-hand sidewalk edge, demarcating the boundary between the pedestrian path and the driving lane, steering the flow of traffic and limiting the opportunity for the ego car to veer onto the pavement in emergencies. Lastly, several trash bins are observed on the right, situated on the sidewalk. While they do not pose a direct hazard, thereâ€™s a need for vigilance concerning any service activities or persons that might appear from adjacent areas or sidewalks to approach these bins.\n\nThe JSON data did not list any traffic lights, traffic cones, or other noteworthy road users, so our attention is confined to the identified elements above."
