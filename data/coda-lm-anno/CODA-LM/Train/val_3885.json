A white car is parked on the right side of the road, partly on the grass and partly on the pavement. This parked vehicle could potentially obstruct traffic if it unexpectedly moves into the roadway.\n2. Several cars are driving in the opposite lane, indicating the normal flow of traffic and suggesting that the ego car must be cautious of oncoming traffic when making driving decisions.\n\nAdditionally, a temporary road work sign is placed on the right side of the road next to the parked white vehicle. This sign typically signifies the presence of road work ahead, indicating a need for caution, potentially reduced speed, and awareness of workers or machinery.\n\nMoreover, orange traffic cones are arranged in a line on the right side of the road leading towards a road work barrier. These cones direct the flow of traffic away from the road work area, indicating that the ego vehicle should stay within the marked limits to ensure safety and compliance with road regulations.\n\nA barrier is positioned just after the construction sign, blocking the right-most part of the lane in connection with the ongoing road work. This barrier protects road workers and keeps traffic away from the construction zone, suggesting the ego car should move slightly to the left to avoid the barrier.\n\nFinally, a stationary construction excavator is located on the right side beside the barriers within the road work area. While it does not directly impede traffic flow, its proximity to the roadway poses a potential risk if it were to move suddenly or if debris were dislodged into the path of the ego vehicle."
