However, there are other objects of note. Specifically, large rolls of cable and miscellaneous equipment are stacked on the sides of the road, which reduces the width of the navigable roadway. The presence of these objects could potentially obscure or hide pedestrians, and as a result, it necessitates that the ego car reduces speed and pays increased attention while navigating through this area."

Often found in industrial or repair shop environments, these stacks can sometimes be intended for recycling or disposal. In a driving scenario, such stacks must be noted as they can indicate the presence of industrial activity or maintenance operations nearby. Drivers should be cautious about potential movements of vehicles or persons related to this activity, which could affect driving decisions like speed and lane choice.",

The ego car should maintain alertness for construction signs, reduced speed limits, or detour directions, and the driver should be prepared to adapt to unexpected conditions such as workers or equipment entering the roadway.",
