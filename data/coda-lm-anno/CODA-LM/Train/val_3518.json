This excavator is a large construction vehicle that could initiate unexpected movements or have parts extending into the roadway. Its presence also indicates potential construction activity nearby, which may affect road conditions. Additionally, there is a metal fence running parallel to the roadway on the right side. This fence functions as a barrier, restricting access to the construction site or off-road areas, thereby funneling traffic into the remaining accessible lanes and possibly narrowing the available road space."

It is equipped with a hydraulic arm and a large digging bucket, used primarily for heavy construction tasks like digging trenches, lifting heavy materials, and demolishing structures. The presence of this construction vehicle suggests active construction work in the area. This information is crucial for the ego car's driving strategy as it might indicate potential slow-downs, detours, or debris in the vicinity. The driver should approach the area with increased caution, anticipating possible changes in road conditions or unexpected obstructions.",

It is advisable to stay vigilant for any potential movements of the excavator or sudden appearance of construction workers. The presence of snow requires the vehicle to have heightened traction control and possibly engage systems fit for icy conditions. Avoid the rightmost part of the lane where snow accumulation is greater."
