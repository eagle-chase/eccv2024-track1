The truck's larger size also indicates a need for a greater stopping distance. There is a yellow SUV positioned alongside the ego vehicle in a separate lane, which requires careful consideration for any lateral movements such as lane changes by the ego vehicle. No pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists are present, reducing immediate concern for vulnerable road users but necessitating continued attentiveness.\n\nAdditionally, a green traffic light is ahead, allowing the ego vehicle to proceed while staying alert for any changes in the signal. Orange traffic cones on the right side of the road point to construction or a lane closure, advising caution and a slower speed. Temporary fencing alongside these cones indicates a construction zone or work area, suggesting the need for careful navigation due to potential changes in road conditions and traffic patterns. Lastly, construction equipment is present beyond the barriers, signaling ongoing work which may lead to the presence of workers or unexpected movements close to the roadway, necessitating cautious driving from the ego vehicle."
