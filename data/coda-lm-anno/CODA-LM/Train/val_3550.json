On the right side of the road, there is a yellow construction roller, which is part of ongoing roadworks. This roller affects the drivable area and may influence traffic flow, requiring the ego car to navigate carefully around it. Ahead of the ego vehicle, several cars are visible, which dictate the driving speed and stopping distance, thus influencing the ego car's following distance and necessitating speed adjustments. Additionally, there is a green-topped bus in the left lane, slightly ahead of the ego car. The bus may make frequent stops, potentially requiring the ego car to alter its speed or change lanes for maintaining smooth traffic flow. Moreover, traffic cones are lined along the right side of the road, marking the boundary of the construction zone. These cones reduce the drivable width of the road and guide traffic to move left to avoid hazards."
