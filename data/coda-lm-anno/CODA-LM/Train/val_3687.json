        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there are several key elements that are notable for their impact on driving behavior and road safety. \n\nFirst, there are two vehicles of interest. A red truck is positioned on the right side of the road, encroaching upon the pedestrian walkway, and is facing the opposite direction of the ego vehicle's travel. The presence of the truck suggests it may be in the process of unloading goods. This situation poses a potential hazard, as the vehicle could unexpectedly move, or people moving around it could enter the roadway. Additionally, a blue tractor is visible on the right side, facing in the same direction as the ego vehicle. The tractor might be stationary or moving slowly. Its presence contributes to road congestion and represents a potential hazard if it were to suddenly veer into the ego vehicle’s path.\n\nRegarding vulnerable road users, there is at least one pedestrian on the left side of the road, walking in the same direction as the ego vehicle. The pedestrian’s proximity to the driving lane escalates the risk of potential collision, particularly if the pedestrian were to unexpectedly enter the lane.\n\nThere are also other objects in the scene that warrant mention. Notably, piles of white construction materials or debris are located on the right sidewalk, close to the red truck. Although these materials do not directly block the road, their presence indicates ongoing construction activity. This activity could lead to unexpected incursions into the roadway or cause pedestrians to navigate closer to or within the driving lanes.\n\nIn this described scene, there are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present that require attention or explanation. The highlighted elements - vehicles, a vulnerable road user, and construction materials - collectively inform the driving conditions and necessitate cautious navigation to ensure safety."

Passing should be done with caution, ensuring that there is enough space and that it is legal and safe to do so."
