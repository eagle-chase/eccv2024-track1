        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are a couple of notable vehicles. Firstly, a white sedan is parked on the right side of the road, facing away from the ego vehicle. Although this vehicle is stationary and doesn't pose a significant immediate threat, it requires caution from the ego car to prevent any unexpected movements, such as door openings or the car suddenly pulling out into traffic. Additionally, there are multiple vehicles parked along both sides of the road ahead. The presence of these vehicles might narrow the drivable space on the roadway. Consequently, the ego car needs to adjust its speed and be prepared for pedestrians that may emerge from between these parked vehicles. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image."
