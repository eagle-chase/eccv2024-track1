        "description and explanation": "The image contains two categories of road users. \n\nFirstly, there is a vehicle present, specifically a white van. This van is located on the right side of the road from the perspective of the ego vehicle and is facing the opposite direction. Although the van is currently parked and not an immediate moving hazard, it's important to note its presence. This is due to the potential for unpredictable movements, such as the van pulling out into the road, or passengers exiting the vehicle which could pose a risk.\n\nSecondly, there are vulnerable road users in the image. One is a pedestrian, who is wearing a light-colored top and dark pants. This pedestrian is walking along the left side of the road, moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. Pedestrians can change direction or enter the driving lane unexpectedly, so it's crucial for the ego vehicle to maintain a safe distance and speed. Additionally, there is a small dog on a leash near the white van on the right side of the road. Even though the dog is on a leash, animals can be unpredictable. Therefore, the ego vehicle should be prepared to stop or slow down if necessary.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image."
