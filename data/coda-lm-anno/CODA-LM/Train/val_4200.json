        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are several road users and objects that are significantly affecting the driving behavior of the ego car. Firstly, a large truck is positioned directly in front of the ego car within the same lane, which potentially reduces visibility for the driver of the ego car, thus requiring careful speed control and distance management. Alongside this, a red SUV is located ahead in the left lane next to the truck, in a slightly forward position. The SUV's position suggests that it may be overtaking or has just overtaken the truck, which should be taken into account for any lane change decisions and while adjusting speed.\n\nAdditionally, a green traffic light is visible right ahead but itâ€™s slightly obscured by the height of the truck. This indicates that the traffic is permitted to move forward; however, the driver needs to be cautious due to the impaired visibility of this signal. This scenario is further complicated by the presence of a green light on the traffic light directly ahead, also partially obstructed by the truck, signaling that legal progression is allowed but vigilance is needed for any sudden changes in the light.\n\nMoreover, temporary construction barriers are observed on the right side of the road, surrounding a construction zone. These barriers suggest a reduction in road width and potential nearby construction activity, which necessitates reduced speeds and increased alertness from the driver.\n\nThis traffic situation includes a mix of large vehicles, traffic lights with visibility issues due to obstruction, and construction barriers on the roadway, all contributing to complex driving dynamics which require careful attention and responsive driving actions."

Due to the construction barriers, the ego car should consider reducing speed and be prepared for possible obstructions or changes in road conditions."
