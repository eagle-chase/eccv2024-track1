Firstly, there is a gray sedan in the left lane with its brake lights on, indicating that it is either slowing down or has come to a stop. This situation influences the ego car's decision-making, necessitating a reduction in speed or a complete stop to maintain safety.\n\nAdditionally, a construction truck is present in the right lane. It is easily identifiable by the ladder and hazard signage it carries. The truck is partially obstructing the driving path, which could pose a potential hazard. As a result, the ego car may need to change lanes or slow down to safely navigate around the truck.\n\nFor navigational purposes, there are directional signs overhead that provide the names of upcoming roads. While these signs do not have an immediate impact on driving behavior, they are important for the ego car's route planning.\n\nRegarding traffic lights, the specific light for the ego car's lane is not visible in the image. However, other traffic lights in the scene are green. This means the ego car should be ready to stop if its traffic light is red or proceed with caution if the light is green, once the state of the light becomes clear.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
