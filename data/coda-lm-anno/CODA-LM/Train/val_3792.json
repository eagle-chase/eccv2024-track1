It is a large, multi-axle truck carrying construction machinery, identified as a possible pavement planer mounted on the trailer. This type of vehicle usually travels at slower speeds due to its size and the heavy equipment it carries. Drivers of nearby vehicles, including the ego car, should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential slow-downs or sudden stops that can occur when such vehicles maneuver or when they are part of active construction zones.",

It has large, sturdy wheels and a hopper at the front for holding asphalt or other paving materials. The vehicle is designed to distribute and flatten paving materials on road surfaces during construction and maintenance works. The presence of this construction vehicle indicates road work ahead. This necessitates the ego vehicle to possibly reduce speed and be alert for sudden stops or changes in traffic flow, ensuring safety and compliance with any temporary road signs or regulations that might be in place due to construction activities.",
