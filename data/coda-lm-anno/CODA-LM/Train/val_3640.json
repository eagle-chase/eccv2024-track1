This agricultural vehicle is potentially hazardous as it likely moves more slowly than general traffic. The presence of this vehicle necessitates that the autonomous vehicle may have to decelerate or come to a stop to ensure there is a safe following distance and to avoid a collision."

The presence of this type of vehicle on or near the roadway suggests ongoing construction activity, which could influence the future driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating reduced speeds, increased caution, and possibly adherence to altered traffic patterns or detours. The driver of the ego car should stay alert for construction signs, workers, and sudden stops or merges caused by the construction.",
