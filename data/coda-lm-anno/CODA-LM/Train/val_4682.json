The truck is easily identifiable due to its significant structural features, including visible mixing equipment and contents, likely wet cement. This is potentially hazardous if spilled.\n  - **Explanation**: The truck's size and the fact that it is transporting possibly hazardous materials mean it may move slowly and make sudden stops. Its proximity and potential for spillage directly impact the ego car's driving behavior.\n\n- **Traffic Lights**: \n  - There is a traffic light in the distance showing green.\n  - **Explanation**: The green light allows vehicles, including the ego vehicle, to proceed. However, due to the unpredictable nature of the large truck ahead, readiness to stop is crucial."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, specifically a large truck used for transporting construction materials. It is characterized by a heavily built structure and is carrying what appears to be a load secured with a tarp. The presence of this vehicle influences the driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating increased caution and potentially reduced speed. The driver must remain alert for sudden stops or debris falling from the vehicle, which could pose hazards on the road.",

Keep the vehicle aligned in the current lane to avoid any sudden lane changes in response to the truck's actions."
