It is designed to ensure the safety of both the construction workers and the motorists by preventing accidental entry into the construction area. For the approaching ego vehicle, this barrier signifies that it must remain on the designated roadway and not veer towards the construction zone. The presence of such barriers generally indicates ongoing construction or temporary changes in traffic patterns, and drivers should be cautious, reducing speed if necessary.",
