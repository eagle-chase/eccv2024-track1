The presence of the forklift is indicative of either stationary parking or active roadside operation, creating potential hazards from sudden movement or shifting loads. Additionally, there are traffic lights on the road showing a red light, signaling vehicles to stop for safe and regulated traffic flow at the intersection. Alongside the roadway on the right, there are green barriers covered with tarps, signifying ongoing construction or roadwork. These barriers indicate that the lane next to them may be closed or restricted, necessitating caution, potentially lower speeds, or a lane change to ensure safety. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects present in this image."

This type of vehicle is typically used in construction areas for moving heavy materials or loading and unloading tasks. In a driving scenario, the presence of a construction vehicle like this one should alert the driver to the potential presence of a construction site nearby, which may involve additional hazards such as debris, temporary signage, detours, or workers on or near the roadway. The driver of the ego car should be prepared to reduce speed and proceed with heightened caution, possibly following any temporary traffic controls or detour instructions for safe navigation through or around the construction area.",
