The truck is visible from its left rear side, revealing the rear wheel and a part of the cargo area. The side of the truck displays various texts and numbers, which seem to provide information related to weight limits and operating details, and this information is in Chinese. The relative positioning of the truck suggests it could be either stationary or moving in the same direction as the ego car. The size of the truck necessitates caution from the ego car due to the truck's potential large blind spots, and the risk associated with the truck's capability for sudden stops or turns.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects identified in this image, so these categories are not included in the summary."

The text includes information like vehicle weight and contact details, probably for business or regulatory purposes.
