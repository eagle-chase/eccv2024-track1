The truck's extended structures and mechanisms could obscure visibility and take up additional space on the road. Due to its size and the presence of extended equipment, the truck could make sudden movements or stops, creating potential road hazards that the ego car needs to monitor closely.\n\nAdditionally, a white car is partially visible to the right of the concrete truck. Its proximity to the large truck may influence its behavior, such as sudden lane changes or braking, which increases the risk of a collision with the ego car.\n\nSeveral pedestrians are observed crossing the street through the concrete pump's structures on the right side. They are actively walking across the pedestrian crossing. The presence of pedestrians in the crosswalk means the ego car must yield and cannot proceed until the crossing is clear, as they have the right of way.\n\nA traffic light near the group of pedestrians is in the red phase, indicating that vehicles, including the ego car, are required to stop and not proceed through the intersection until the light turns green.\n\nUrban elements like railings and greenspaces are present along the edges of the road. These elements are important as they define the boundaries of the road and indicate areas where pedestrians may be present, which requires the ego car to navigate with increased caution."

    "region_perception": {},
    "driving_suggestion": "The ego car should maintain a safe following distance from the truck ahead, preparing for potential stops or slow movement due to the truck's operational needs. Additionally, observing the state of the traffic light and the pedestrians' presence, the ego car should remain stopped until the light turns green and the pedestrian crossing is clear. Monitoring other vehicles, particularly the white car, for unexpected lane changes or stops is also crucial."
