This vehicle is quite substantial in size and has machinery extending from its rear. The presence and dimensions of this agricultural machine make it challenging for the ego car to overtake safely, and as a result, the ego car may need to reduce its speed and await a suitable opportunity to pass, leading to potential delays.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic bollard on the right-hand side of the road, characterized by its red and white stripes. The bollard signifies a no-pass zone or could be an indication of the road narrowing ahead. The ego car must be vigilant in response to this bollard, as it may need to make adjustments to its course or prepare for alterations in the road conditions."
