This type of vehicle is typically large and heavy, equipped with a mixing drum used commonly for cement or concrete. In driving scenarios, the presence of such a vehicle can significantly influence traffic flow and safety. Drivers of the ego car must maintain a safe distance from this construction vehicle to avoid any potential accidents caused by debris falling from the vehicle or sudden stops made by the vehicle. Additionally, due to the vehicle's slow-moving nature, the ego car might need to adjust its speed or switch lanes to bypass the construction vehicle, ensuring smoother and safer passage.",
