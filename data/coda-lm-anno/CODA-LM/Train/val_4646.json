        "description and explanation": "The traffic scenario presents several elements that the autonomous vehicle must consider. On the left side, a blue bus is moving parallel to the ego car, which poses a potential traffic flow issue if it stops to pick up or offload passengers. To the right, there is a dark sedan in the right-most lane just ahead of the autonomous vehicle. It is important to monitor this sedan as it may change lanes or decelerate due to the roadwork. Additionally, there are mini trucks and construction equipment scattered along the right side, partaking in the roadwork. These vehicles pose a risk of entering the driving lane or affecting the movement of other vehicles.\n\nThe scenario also includes multiple construction workers near and on the roadway, representing potential hazards due to their potential to move unpredictably into the path of the ego car.\n\nWhile there are no traffic signs present, a traffic light ahead displays a green signal, allowing the ego car to move forward. However, caution is urged due to the presence of various road users and work activity. The right side of the road is marked by orange traffic cones indicating a road work area, which signals a lane reduction and calls for a slower speed and heightened awareness.\n\nThere are no barriers or other objects reported that could impact driving behavior in the given scene.\n"
