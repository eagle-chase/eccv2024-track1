        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, there are several notable road users and elements impacting the driving behavior of the ego vehicle:\n\nFirstly, there is a large yellow construction vehicle directly in front of the ego vehicle, equipped with a lifting mechanism, possibly a forklift. This vehicle has hazard markings and its brake lights are on, indicating that it is either slowing down or stopped. This vehicle critically affects the ego vehicle as its large size and position may obscure visibility ahead, and its stoppage necessitates reducing speed or coming to a complete halt.\n\nAdditionally, there is a red truck visible on the left side ahead, though it is slightly obscured by the yellow construction vehicle. The red truck, either moving or parked in the adjacent lane, must be considered for lane change decisions or if it starts moving into the ego vehicle's lane.\n\nFurthermore, a traffic light ahead shows red on the upper portion of the traffic signal, likely at an intersection. This traffic light is crucial for driving behavior, as its red state requires the ego vehicle to stop or be prepared to stop to comply with traffic regulations."

            "description and explanation": "This image shows a large construction vehicle, distinguished by its heavy-duty structure and specialized equipment mounted on the back. The vehicle is typically used in construction projects or large-scale industrial environments for tasks that involve lifting, carrying, or moving heavy materials. The presence of this vehicle on the road may require drivers in surrounding vehicles, including the ego car, to exercise increased caution. Drivers should keep a safe following distance and be prepared for potential stops or slow movement from the construction vehicle due to its size and the operational requirements of maneuvering such large equipment.",
