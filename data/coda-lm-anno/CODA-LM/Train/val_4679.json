Similarly, there are no traffic signs or traffic cones noted in the image.\n\nHowever, the traffic light positioned in the center is showing red for the direction the ego vehicle is facing and green for the cross traffic. This means the ego car is obliged to come to a full stop at the intersection and wait until the light turns green before continuing. This ensures the ego car complies with traffic regulations and maintains safety by preventing an intersection crossing that could potentially lead to a collision.\n\nAdditionally, there are barriers with yellow and black stripes situated on the left side of the intersection, which signals a lane closure or construction zone. The ego vehicle must, therefore, be ready to alter its lane or reduce speed as needed to maneuvere through this area with caution.\n\nLastly, the scene contains a crane on the right side that appears to be lifting materials, indicative of construction activities occurring nearby. The ego vehicle should thus be extra vigilant to account for potential unpredicted obstacles or changes in the road conditions that could arise due to the nearby construction work."
