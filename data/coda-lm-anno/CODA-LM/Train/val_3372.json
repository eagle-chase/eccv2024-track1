This van could potentially change lanes or decelerate, impacting the driving route of the ego car. Additionally, pedestrians are present on the right pavement, with one particularly close to the curb and facing the road, indicating a possibility of attempting to cross the street. This necessitates the ego car to be prepared to stop and give way.\n\nAlthough the traffic light in the direction the ego car is traveling is green, indicating that it should continue, the driver must remain vigilant, especially considering the pedestrian who may step into the crosswalk.\n\nOther elements in the vicinity, such as street lights and buildings, are noted in the background. Although they do not have a direct effect on the ego car's immediate driving decisions, they do play a role in the overall visibility and context of the driving environment."
