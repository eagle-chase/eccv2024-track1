Ahead in the left lane, there is a yellow van moving in the same direction, and the ego car should watch it for any potential lane changes or sudden movements. On the right side of the road, there are green buses, with one stationed at a bus stop and another in the process of transit. The ego car should be vigilant for pedestrians that might step out from the bus and for the bus potentially merging into traffic.\n\nOn the left sidewalk, there is a pedestrian wearing reflective clothing, likely a construction worker or road maintenance crew member, and the ego car should be prepared for the possibility of the pedestrian entering the roadway and yield if needed. Additionally, there is a cart and possible debris in the road work area on the left, indicating ongoing construction, which means the ego car should proceed with caution due to potential temporary obstructions or the presence of workers.\n\nThe traffic scene includes a red traffic light in the distance beyond the black van, and the ego car should get ready to stop unless the light changes. Temporary road barriers are present on the left side, delineating the construction zone from the active traffic lanes, and the ego car should stay to the right to keep a safe distance from the work area.\n\nLastly, there is a reflection on the windshield, which could be due to a wet surface or light glare, and the ego car's vision system needs to be equipped to handle potential visual impairments caused by such reflections."
