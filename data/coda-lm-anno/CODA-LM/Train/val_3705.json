        "description and explanation": "The traffic scene is comprised of several elements affecting the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle. There are multiple vehicles ahead with their red tail lights visible, suggesting that they are either decelerating or at a complete stop. The ego car must be ready to slow down or halt as necessary, ensuring a safe distance is maintained from these vehicles. Additionally, a vehicle is detected parked on the right side of the road, as indicated by the visibility of its red tail light and lack of movement. Here, the ego car is advised to keep its current lane position and be vigilant for any unexpected activity from the parked vehicle.\n\nFurther along, a traffic light that is showing green can be seen at a distance, signaling that vehicles are currently allowed to continue in that direction. While the ego car is cleared to move forward, caution is advised since the traffic light may switch to a different color by the time the vehicle approaches the intersection.\n\nOn the right side of the road, traffic cones are present, possibly signifying roadwork or a road hazard nearby. The autonomous vehicle should, therefore, decrease speed and stay ready to maneuver into a different lane if it becomes necessary to avoid potential risks."

It usually has a bright color and reflective materials to ensure it is highly visible, even during nighttime or in low-light conditions. Traffic cones are commonly utilized to alert drivers of roadworks, obstacles, or temporary traffic changes, guiding or rerouting traffic around hazards. Its presence often indicates that the driver should exercise caution and reduce speed to navigate potential hazards or changes in the typical traffic pattern safely. Observing this cone, the driver of the ego car should remain vigilant, adjust speed, and be prepared for possible lane closures or shifts that require attention.",
