This plays a part in the navigation process and confirms the route that should be followed by the vehicle, guiding the decision-making process.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a formation of orange traffic cones, arranged to limit access to a part of the lane. This arrangement is indicative of possible road works or another reason which necessitates the merging of traffic to the left. Consequently, the ego vehicle must adjust its driving path to accommodate this restriction.\n\nAdditionally, there are metal barriers erected on both sides of the road. These barriers serve to delineate the driving path, directing the flow of vehicles and preventing any deviation from the road, thus safeguarding all road users.\n\nNo traffic lights, other vehicles, or additional objects are noted in this traffic image."
