These cones serve as a warning for drivers, indicating that there is a potential hazard or roadwork ahead, and they guide traffic to merge into the right lane to avoid the blocked left lane.\n\nAdditionally, there are metal barriers topped with green-painted wire mesh and barbed wire running along the right side of the road. These barriers are in place to prevent unauthorized access from the side of the road and to ensure the safety of vehicles by keeping them within the road limits.\n\nLastly, the image includes shadows cast by overhead structures on the roadway.
