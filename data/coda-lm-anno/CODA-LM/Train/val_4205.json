The ego car needs to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for a change in speed or a full stop.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the road, there is a person in protective clothing, including a mask, walking towards a gated area. Due to the pedestrian's closeness to the road and the possibility of unexpected movement, the ego car should slow down and pass by with caution.\n\nAdditionally, a roadwork sign is visible on the right-hand side, indicating current or upcoming road construction that could include lane narrowing or diversions. As a result, the ego car should remain vigilant for any changes in the road layout or potential hazards.\n\nThe traffic lights above the road are green in the lane the ego car is in, indicating that it is legal and safe for the car to continue. Despite the green light, the ego car should still pay attention to the surrounding conditions and road users.\n\nOn the left boundary of the ego car's lane, there are orange safety cones aligned, suggesting there is a restricted area due to road work or an obstruction. The ego car should drive cautiously within the cones' boundary.\n\nMetal guardrails are installed along the right side of the road, serving as safety barriers that prevent vehicles from leaving the roadway. It's important for the ego car to keep a safe distance from these barriers by maintaining a proper lane position.\n\nFinally, there is a small blue-and-white canopy tent on the right side, near the pedestrian, indicating possible activities near the road. This may mean more pedestrians or stopped vehicles could be in the vicinity, and the ego car should proceed with increased caution."
