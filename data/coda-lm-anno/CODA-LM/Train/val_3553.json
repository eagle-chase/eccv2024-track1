Due to its substantial size and position, it is expected to impede the flow of traffic, making it necessary for the ego car and other vehicles to either slow down or switch lanes to safely pass by this obstruction.\n\nAdditionally, there are blue directional signs mounted overhead. These signs are critical as they guide the ego car by indicating the proper lanes to be in for upcoming roads or exits, which assists in making informed decisions regarding lane changes or preparations for these exits. \n\nNo other objects, such as vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or miscellaneous items, are present in this traffic image and thus have no relevance to the ego car's immediate driving decisions."
