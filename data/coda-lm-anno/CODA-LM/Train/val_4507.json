Directly ahead of the ego car, there is a white passenger car driving in the same lane. Since it is in the ego car's traffic lane, the ego car's driving system must be ready to react to any of the white car's maneuvers, like changes in speed or sudden stops.\n\nOn the sidewalk to the left of the road, there is a pedestrian walking. Although a fence separates them from the road, their presence still necessitates careful driving from the ego car, particularly in situations where they might cross the road unexpectedly.\n\nThe image shows several banners and poles with various signs, but no specific traffic signs are seen that would impact immediate driving decisions. While these non-traffic signs could cause some visual distraction, they do not demand an immediate reaction from the ego vehicle's driving system.\n\nAt an intersection directly ahead, there's a green traffic light hung over the road. This indicates that the ego car is free to continue driving through the intersection, as long as no sudden obstacles appear or the light doesn't change unexpectedly.\n\nA number of traffic cones are set up around a central part of the intersection, suggesting roadwork or an area that vehicles need to circumvent. The ego car will need to slightly alter its course to sidestep the coned area safely.\n\nAdditionally, fences and barriers are in place to demarcate the pedestrian area from the roadway near the intersection. These structures guide the ego car to adhere strictly to its lane, thus helping to prevent any intrusion into the pedestrian space.\n\nThere are no other objects mentioned in the dataset that could impact the ego vehicle's driving behavior."
