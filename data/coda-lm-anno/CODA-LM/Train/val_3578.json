These vehicles' presence requires the ego car's attention regarding speed moderation and potential braking due to their proximity.\n\nAdjacent to the ego car's lane, on the left, there is a white hatchback and a larger gray vehicle also traveling parallel to the ego car. These vehicles' speeds and positions must be closely watched as they will influence any potential lane-changing maneuvers that the ego car might need to perform.\n\nWithin the vicinity, two motorcyclists wearing blue jackets and identifiable branding on their backs are slightly ahead and to the right in the same lane as the ego car. The agile nature of motorcyclists means the ego car must keep a close watch on them to anticipate any rapid changes in their speed or lane positioning which could impact the ego car's driving decisions.\n\nAn orange traffic cone is located on the lane dividing line directly in front of the ego car. This cone is likely marking a road hazard or construction work and signals to the ego car the importance of keeping within the lane and being ready to reduce speed.\n\nAdditionally, the scene includes yellow safety barriers along the side of the road separating the opposing directions of traffic flow. These barriers contribute to the ego car's spatial positioning, requiring it to keep a safe distance to avoid any collision with the barriers.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects reported in the scene that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
