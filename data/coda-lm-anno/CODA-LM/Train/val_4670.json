The size and position of the truck are significant as they obstruct part of the ego car's lane, which could lead to a potential collision if not navigated carefully.\n\nAdditionally, there are red and white rectangular signs with Chinese characters on barriers, which indicate 'no entry' or similar restrictions. These signs suggest that there may be road conditions or construction ahead that require caution or could limit access.\n\nThe road also features blue and white barriers lining the middle, separating the lanes. These barriers indicate that there might be construction or closed sections of the road, which would limit the space available for maneuvering.\n\nOn the left side of the road, there are blue vertical poles that define the lane divisions. These poles are helpful for guiding the vehicle's lateral placement on the road, ensuring that the ego car stays within its designated lane.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or traffic cones present in this image."
