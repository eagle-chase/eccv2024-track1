Some are waiting to cross, while others are in the process of crossing. The presence of pedestrians in and around the crosswalk area necessitates caution from the ego car, which must be prepared to stop.\n\nAdditionally, a traffic light is visible at the intersection, showing green for the ego car's direction of travel. This green light indicates that the ego car has the right of way to proceed through the intersection but must remain vigilant for crossing traffic and pedestrians.\n\nLastly, a small cart is spotted on the right side of the road, close to the crosswalk. This cart could potentially move onto the roadway, presenting an obstacle that might require the ego car to slow down or change lanes to avoid it."
