        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are a couple of notable road users. Directly in front of the ego vehicle, there is a large truck with the label 'TOOMILONE'. This truck has multiple reflective markings and illuminated lights, making it visible even when the lighting conditions are poor. The presence of this truck is important to note because it takes up a large part of the lane and may restrict the ego vehicle's options to overtake or switch lanes due to its considerable size and the generally slower movement associated with heavy trucks.\n\nAdditionally, several passenger cars are nearby, with one in particular being close to the right side of the ego vehicle's lane. These passenger cars represent dynamic obstacles that the ego vehicle must safely maneuver around, ensuring proper following distances and keeping a safe lateral space between them and the ego vehicle. \n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the traffic image, indicating that the ego vehicle's main focus should be on the large truck directly ahead and the passenger cars around it."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a large commercial truck, identified by its prominent size and the way its trailer extends horizontally across the image. Due to its substantial dimensions, trucks typically move slower than smaller vehicles, especially on highways. The ego car must maintain a safe following distance from this truck, taking into account the truck's larger blind spots and the potential for sudden stops or changes in lane. This requires heightened awareness from the ego car's driver to anticipate any possible maneuvering by the truck.",

Monitor the cars around, especially the one to the right, to anticipate any sudden lane changes they might make. Since it is nighttime and visibility is reduced, ensure all headlights and necessary lights are active to improve visibility and signal presence to other road users. Avoid any lane changes or overtaking until there is clear visibility and space to do so safely."
