This vehicle is across the intersection and seems to be waiting to cross or turn, which may affect the ego car's ability to move through the intersection. On the sidewalk to the right, there is a pedestrian, and further away, there appears to be another person on a motorcycle. The pedestrian is not currently crossing the road but should be monitored, while the motorcycle may enter the roadway, requiring the ego vehicle to exercise caution. Additionally, there are multiple traffic signs on the right that indicate no parking, provide directions for a roundabout, and offer other routing details. These signs are important for the ego car's navigation and indicate that a roundabout is ahead, influencing routing decisions. The traffic lights above the intersection show green for going straight or turning left and red for turning right, allowing the ego car to proceed through the intersection or turn left, but not to turn right. Traffic cones are positioned on the right side of the intersection, indicating a potential road hazard or construction area, which may reduce the road width and necessitate careful maneuvering by the ego car. There are no barriers or other objects present in the image."
