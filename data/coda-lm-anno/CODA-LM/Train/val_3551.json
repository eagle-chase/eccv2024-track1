The presence of this truck is critical as it limits the ego car's ability to maneuver or change lanes to the left.\n\nSecondly, directly in front of the ego car, there is red and yellow construction machinery occupying the same lane and moving in the same direction as the ego car. This machinery may move slower than the general traffic flow, requiring the ego car to keep a safe following distance or consider changing lanes to pass if it is safe and legal to do so.\n\nLastly, several cars are ahead of the ego vehicle, some with their brake lights on, indicating that traffic is slowing or stopped further down the road. This signals congestion ahead, which will require the ego car to be prepared to reduce speed or come to a stop."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a large construction vehicle equipped with specialized machinery, likely used for tasks such as roadwork or construction. The presence of this type of vehicle in traffic can significantly influence driving behavior. Due to its size and the type of equipment it carries, it may move slower than standard vehicles and require more space to maneuver. Drivers behind and around this construction vehicle should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential sudden stops or reduced speed, ensuring safety and preventing accidents.",
