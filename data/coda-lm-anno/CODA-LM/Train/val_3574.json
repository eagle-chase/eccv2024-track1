It appears in a typical cone shape with alternating stripes of orange and white, which provide high visibility. Its placement on the road usually indicates that drivers should steer clear of a specific area for safety reasons, such as ongoing roadwork, redirection of traffic, or temporary obstruction. For the ego car, seeing this traffic cone means that the driver should remain alert, reduce speed if necessary, and possibly change lanes to avoid the coned-off area.",
