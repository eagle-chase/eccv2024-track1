Firstly, there is a light blue mini truck on the right side of the road, covered with a tarp and parked. This vehicle is stationary and may partially obstruct the lane, which could necessitate the ego car to adjust its path slightly to the left to avoid it. Additionally, there is a green heavy truck on the right, which appears to be in motion and is occupying the right lane. The presence of this moving truck is likely to influence the lane choice and potential merging actions of the ego car.\n\nAlso present in the scene is a small, light-colored dog on the right side, moving across the road. The dog's unpredictable movements may require the ego car to be prepared to stop or slow down to avoid a potential hazard.\n\nWhile there are multiple overhead cables visible, they do not have a direct effect on the road space or the driving behavior of the ego car. However, they are still noted as part of the overall scene.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image that affect the driving conditions for the ego car."
