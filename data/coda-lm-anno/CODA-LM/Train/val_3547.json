A white sedan on the left side of the road, positioned parallel to the ego car and stationary. This vehicle could potentially open a door or pull out onto the road, requiring the ego car to maintain a safe distance.\n2. A silver sedan directly ahead of the ego car, also stationary with its brake lights on. The behavior of this vehicle will directly impact the ego car's movement, especially if it starts moving or if the brake lights go off, indicating a potential move.\n3. Construction vehicles on the right side of the road, positioned perpendicular to the ego car and stationary. These large vehicles may obstruct the view of the road ahead and indicate potential construction activity which may affect road conditions.\n\nAdditionally, there are orange traffic cones aligned alongside blue construction barriers on the right, narrowing the lane. These cones indicate lane narrowing, which requires the ego car to adjust its lane position and be prepared for potential merging traffic.\n\nFinally, blue construction barriers are encroaching into the lane on the right side of the road. These barriers narrow the available driving space for the ego car and may necessitate a lane change if construction activity is present."

Vehicles like this are typically used in construction zones for tasks involving heavy lifting, material transport, or other construction activities. The presence of such a vehicle on the road usually indicates nearby construction activity. For the ego car, this means increased caution may be necessary while driving near this vehicle due to potential sudden stops, slow movement, or the possibility of construction materials being nearby or on the roadway. Adjustment in driving speed and heightened awareness are advised to safely navigate near this area.",
