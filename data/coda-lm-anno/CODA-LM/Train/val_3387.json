This necessitates the ego car to regulate its speed to maintain a safe following distance due to the sedan's current pace and position.\n\nAdditionally, there are traffic cones set up in the right lane, implying that this particular lane is unavailable for use. These traffic cones require the ego car to continue in the current lane or switch lanes if needed to accommodate the altered road conditions.\n\nAlong the left side of the road, metal barriers are installed to demarcate the driving lane from a work zone. The placement of these barriers mandates the ego car to keep a safe clearance from the ongoing construction area.\n\nFurthermore, a substantial crane is present to the right of the scene, signaling construction activities in the proximity. The existence of the crane highlights the importance of cautious driving as there could be distractions or sudden incursions by construction vehicles and personnel."
