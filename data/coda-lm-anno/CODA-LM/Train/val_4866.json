Additionally, multiple orange traffic cones are placed on the left side of the road, suggesting the presence of construction or roadwork. These cones are important as they help to narrow down the usable road space and safely divert traffic away from any possible hazards associated with the construction area. There are no vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, barriers, or other objects present in the image."

Its bright color and reflective strips make it highly visible, even in low light conditions. For the ego car, encountering this cone indicates the necessity to slow down and maneuver carefully to avoid the cone, adhering to potential adjustments in the driving path. This ensures safety for road workers or any road anomalies guarded by the cone.",

The presence of the traffic cone in this scenario suggests that there may be a temporary change in traffic patterns or a potential hazard ahead.
