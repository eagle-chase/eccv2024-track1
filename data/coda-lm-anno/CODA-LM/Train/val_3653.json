It has a license plate and directional arrows indicating it is moving straight, along with operational rear lights suggesting it might be working or slowing down. This implies that the ego car should maintain a safe distance and be ready for potential slowing or stopping of the tanker truck. Additionally, a white SUV is located in the lane to the left of the ego car, slightly ahead. The proximity and position of the SUV mean that the ego car must be aware of its movements, as it may change lanes or adjust speed.\n\nThere is a pedestrian standing on the sidewalk to the right, observing traffic. Although the pedestrian is not on the road, their closeness to the curb requires the ego car to monitor them in case they decide to enter the roadway, enabling the car to react promptly to avoid an accident.\n\nA traffic light is visible high above the intersection, currently displaying a green light in the far distance. This indicates that the ego car can proceed, but it should stay alert as the light could change to yellow or red as the vehicle approaches the intersection."
