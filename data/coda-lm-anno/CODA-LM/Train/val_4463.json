Due to its position and size, the truck may obstruct the lane and reduce visibility ahead, which would affect the ego vehicleâ€™s ability to safely pass or change lanes.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple green traffic lights visible, which signal that the ego vehicle can proceed forward without the need to stop.\n\nReflective barriers are also present, positioned on the right-hand side of the road, marking the lane boundaries. These barriers suggest that there might be a narrowed road section or restricted access, implying that the ego vehicle should navigate the area with caution and possibly at a reduced speed.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects mentioned in the data, indicating that these elements are not present in the traffic scene."
