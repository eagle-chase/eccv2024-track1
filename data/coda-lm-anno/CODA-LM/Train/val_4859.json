Directly in front of the ego car, there is a large, heavy truck carrying a load of construction material. The rear of the truck is partially covered in dust. This truck is a potential hazard as debris may fall onto the road or onto following vehicles, necessitating careful monitoring by the ego car.\n\nAdditionally, there is a white SUV in the left lane next to the ego car. The SUV's position is of concern as it may change lanes or adjust its speed without warning, requiring the ego car to stay attentive to its movements.\n\nOn the far left side of the scene, a cyclist is riding alongside the road. While the cyclist is not currently in the path of the ego car, any sudden changes in direction could impact the driving decisions of the ego car, so it is important to keep an eye on the cyclist.\n\nThe traffic light in the scene is showing a green signal, allowing traffic to proceed. However, the ego car must remain alert as the traffic light could change to yellow or red soon, necessitating a response.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
