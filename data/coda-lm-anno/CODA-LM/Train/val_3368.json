However, it does feature traffic cones, specifically three red and white striped traffic cones positioned in the left lane. The presence of these cones signals that the left lane is currently inaccessible, likely due to construction activities or an obstruction blocking the way. This information is crucial for autonomous driving systems as it helps in adjusting the vehicle's path accordingly to avoid the closed-off lane."

Traffic cones are used to indicate areas where drivers should not drive, commonly demarcating construction zones, areas of hazardous conditions, or other temporary changes in road patterns. In this scenario, the placement of the traffic cone will guide the ego car to avoid the marked section of the road, likely indicating some form of roadwork or obstacle ahead, contributing to safer navigation through the area.",

It is usually employed in road settings to redirect traffic safely around construction sites or road accidents or to indicate temporary traffic changes. In this scenario, the presence of the cone suggests that there may be hazards ahead, roadwork, or changes in typical traffic patterns. As a result, the driver of the ego car should reduce speed and proceed with heightened caution, being prepared to alter the route or follow any additional signs or instructions that might be present further along the road.",
