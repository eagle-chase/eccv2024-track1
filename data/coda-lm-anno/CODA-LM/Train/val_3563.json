        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scenario, there is a large green cement mixer truck on the road. It is driving on the right side, adjacent to the ego car, and partially occupying the next lane. Due to its large size and current position, it's obstructing the ego car's view of the road ahead. This could impact the ego car's ability to change lanes or navigate safely, as the truck creates a blind spot that may conceal potential hazards, including oncoming traffic or obstacles in the road that the ego car might otherwise not be able to see in time to react appropriately. No other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in this traffic image."

The presence of this vehicle on the road indicates that construction activities may be nearby, which could lead to potential hazards such as debris or unusual traffic patterns. The ego car must maintain a safe distance from this heavy vehicle to avoid accidents caused by sudden stops or turns by the truck.",
