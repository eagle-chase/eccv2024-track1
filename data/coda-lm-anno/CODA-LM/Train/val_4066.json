Additionally, the scene includes a blue car behind the orange truck and another service vehicle on the far side of the road, contributing to traffic density and the need for careful monitoring.\n\nThere is a pedestrian in a blue jacket crossing the path where vehicles are merging or turning on the right-hand side, which demands that the autonomous car adjust its speed and remain vigilant to ensure safety. Yellow and black traffic cones line the left side of the road, signaling a change in traffic patterns, possibly due to road work, requiring the ego car to pay extra attention and potentially change lanes.\n\nMetal guardrails are present on the right side of the road, encapsulating the area where the pedestrian is located, limiting the car's ability to swerve and reinforcing the importance of cautious speed control and spatial awareness. Lastly, there is a construction or maintenance operation with visible workers and equipment on the left side of the road, possibly influencing the traffic flow and posing temporary distractions or obstacles."
