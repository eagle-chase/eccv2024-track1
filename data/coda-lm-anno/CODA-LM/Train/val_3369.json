        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there is a significant presence that could affect the driving behavior of our autonomous vehicle. The image contains a large, yellow-colored construction vehicle located on the right side of our ego car's lane. This vehicle is described as moving slowly and has flashing safety lights activated. Due to its size and reduced speed, the construction vehicle could impede the ego car's ability to preserve its current speed. Consequently, the autonomous driving system may need to consider changing lanes to overtake the construction vehicle safely. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image, and hence, no actions or considerations regarding these categories are required."

In a driving scenario, this type of vehicle may move slower compared to regular traffic, necessitating increased caution and possibly a reduced speed from the ego car to maintain a safe following distance. Its presence could also indicate nearby construction activity, suggesting potential changes in traffic patterns or unexpected obstacles ahead.",
