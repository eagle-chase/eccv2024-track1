        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are no vehicles, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present. However, there are vulnerable road users and other objects of note.\n\nA pedestrian, specifically an adult male, is observed standing next to large spools of cable by the roadside. The individual appears to be possibly engaged in work-related activities concerning these spools. The proximity of this person to the roadside could pose a hazard if he were to unexpectedly step onto the road or if any unforeseen movements of the spools or related equipment were to occur.\n\nAdditionally, multiple large spools of cables are present, stacked beside the road. Some of these spools are on their edges while others are lying flat. These objects are considered significant due to their size and placement adjacent to the roadway. There exists a potential risk associated with these spools if any were to roll or shift into the path of the roadway, thus presenting a possible hazard to ongoing traffic."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a large industrial cable reel, typically used for storing and transporting considerable lengths of electrical cables or wires. It is positioned on its side, likely placed temporarily or as a form of storage. In this driving scenario, the presence of such an object near the road requires increased awareness from the ego car's driver. Although it is not directly obstructing the path of travel, its size and the potential for it to be moved or cause obstructions if not securely stationed are factors to consider. The driver should maintain a cautious speed and be prepared for the unexpected presence of similar industrial materials in the area.",

Its presence does not directly influence the driving behavior in this scenario, as it is positioned off the road, behind a low wall. As a driver, understanding that these objects are non-movable obstacles if they were to be closer to or on the road is crucial. Drivers should maintain attention to their right-side clearance when navigating nearby, ensuring that they do not veer too close to the boundary where such objects are stored.",
