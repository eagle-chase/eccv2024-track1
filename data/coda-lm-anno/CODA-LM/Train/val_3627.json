However, there is a notable traffic sign present. The traffic sign described is a blue sign featuring a white arrow and an apple logo, which is positioned on the sidewalk to the right in relation to the ego car. While the sign seems to provide direction or indicate the location of a point of interest, such as a store or attraction, it does not have a direct impact on the current driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle. Nonetheless, being aware of such environmental cues is important for overall situational awareness."

It appears to contain a variety of waste products that are irregular in shape and size, which are not secured and are lying directly in the path of the vehicle. The presence of this garbage on the road can pose a hazard to the ego car, potentially causing damage or necessitating evasive maneuvers to avoid a collision. The driver of the ego car must be cautious, reduce speed, and possibly change lanes to maintain safe passage.",
