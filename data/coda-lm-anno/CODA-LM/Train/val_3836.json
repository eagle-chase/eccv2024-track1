The first vehicle near the ego car is a silver sedan that is facing the ego car while the second, a darker sedan parked in front, is facing away. The presence of these parked cars narrows the road, potentially requiring the ego car to alter its trajectory should an oncoming vehicle appear. Additionally, on the left side of the street rests a road-facing dumpster situated by the sidewalk, adjacent to the parked vehicles. The dumpster could conceal pedestrians emerging onto the road or may limit the ego car's ability to navigate around unexpected obstacles. Other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, and barriers do not present any road users or objects in the image."

The car is parked perpendicular to the viewpoint, suggesting that it is not actively moving but stationary. As the car is parked, it directly influences the navigating behavior of the ego vehicle in this scenario by reducing available space on the right side, thus necessitating careful maneuvering or adjustments in the driving path to avoid any collision when driving past or turning nearby.",

The close proximity of the parked cars on the right suggests that the ego car should also be ready to yield or stop if an oncoming vehicle appears, given the narrowed drivable space. Maintaining a vigilant observation for any unexpected obstacles or road users emerging is crucial."
