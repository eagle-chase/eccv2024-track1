        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image we observe two vehicles. The first one is a cement truck directly in front of the ego car, which is large and seems to be engaged in an operation, either pouring concrete or getting ready to do so, with a mechanism extended above its body. The placement and activity of the cement truck could cause a stoppage or reduce the flow of traffic. Additionally, it obscures the view of the road ahead, necessitating a more cautious approach to driving. The second vehicle is a white compact car positioned in the left lane next to the ego car. The proximity of this vehicle to the ego car means that any decision to change lanes or any necessary adjustments in positioning to maintain a safe distance need to be made with the presence of this car in mind. No other road users, traffic signs, traffic signals, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in the image."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, specifically what appears to be a concrete mixer truck. Characteristics of this vehicle include a large rotating drum used for mixing concrete, which is typically mounted on the back of the truck. The presence of this vehicle influences the driving behavior of surrounding cars, including the ego car, mainly in terms of safety and speed regulation. Drivers may need to maintain a safe distance due to potential debris falling from the truck or sudden stops that these heavy vehicles might make. Furthermore, these trucks usually move slower and make frequent stops, especially at construction sites, requiring nearby drivers to anticipate and adjust their speed accordingly.",

Avoid lane changes to the left unless the white car adjacent changes lane or speeds ahead, ensuring adequate space. Continuous monitoring of the truck's operations and readiness to stop or maneuver to avoid hazards from the truck's operations."
