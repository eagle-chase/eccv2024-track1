Directly ahead, a truck carrying cargo is moving forward, which necessitates the ego car to maintain a safe following distance to prevent collisions. Additionally, multiple heavy construction vehicles, including cranes and trucks, are either stationary or moving slowly in the right lane parallel to the ego car. This requires the ego car to be vigilant for potential lane obstructions or merging vehicles. Further, a yellow crane truck, heavily loaded, is moving in the same direction and poses a risk of load destabilization, requiring the ego car to maintain a lateral safety distance.\n\nOn the footpath to the right, a construction worker is engaged in activities while wearing safety gear, presenting a hazard due to the potential for unexpected movement into the roadway, thus requiring the ego car to slow down and be prepared to stop.\n\nAdditionally, sets of orange traffic cones are visible, marking a construction zone on the right-hand side of the road. These cones indicate lane changes or closures, necessitating the ego car to exercise caution, potentially change lanes, and reduce speed."
