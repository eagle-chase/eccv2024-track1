        "description and explanation": "The scene includes various road users and objects that the autonomous vehicle must account for. On the right side of the road, a silver SUV is parked in a way that it partially obstructs the lane, which means that the autonomous car would need to adjust its path to maintain a safe clearance. Additionally, there are several cars parked on both sides of the lane, reducing the space available and requiring more precise navigation to avoid potential side-swipes.\n\nDriving ahead of the autonomous vehicle is a black sedan, moving in the same direction. The presence of this car means that the autonomous car must keep an appropriate following distance and stay vigilant for any sudden stops or turns this vehicle might make.\n\nOn the pedestrian front, there is a person wearing dark clothing who is walking away from the autonomous vehicle, on the left side of the road. This pedestrian increases the need for cautious driving, especially if the area is a designated pedestrian crossing zone.\n\nTo the right, there is a pile of snow that is encroaching into the driving lane, which not only narrows the travel path but could potentially conceal other hazards. The autonomous vehicle will need to navigate carefully around this obstruction.\n\nLastly, an overturned green dumpster is on the left side of the road, with debris scattered on the roadway. The autonomous vehicle must be prepared for the possibility that other drivers or road users may make unexpected moves to avoid the debris, and the scattered materials themselves could present direct risks to safe driving."

Depending on the behavior of the pedestrian, a complete stop may be required. Driving maneuvers should be smooth to maintain control on the potentially slippery road surface."
