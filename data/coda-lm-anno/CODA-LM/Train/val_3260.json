        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image under observation, there are no vehicles, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present. However, there is one vulnerable road user and some other objects of interest. \n\nThe vulnerable road user is described as a pedestrian who is standing on the side of the road, facing away from the road, and appears to be preoccupied with something on the wall. The proximity of the pedestrian to the driving lane is a potential hazard. There is a concern that if the individual were to step onto the road unexpectedly or drop something onto the driving path, it could pose a danger to the ego car.\n\nAdditionally, there are large industrial spools located adjacent to the pedestrian on the side of the road. While these spools do not directly threaten the ego car's path, they serve as an indicator of an industrial or construction area nearby. This signifies that there might be additional risks nearby such as the possibility of other vehicles entering or exiting the area or the presence of debris on the road."
