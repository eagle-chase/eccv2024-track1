To the left of the ego vehicle, a large red truck is within close proximity, moving in the same direction. The size and presence of this truck are of particular relevance to the ego vehicle's driving behavior, as they could restrict the ability to safely maneuver or change lanes to the left.\n\nDirectly ahead, in the same lane as the ego vehicle, there are several cars, including a white car. The positioning of these vehicles requires the ego car to adjust its speed and maintain a safe following distance, as they control the pace of traffic flow.\n\nLooking ahead, the traffic lights visible in the scene are displaying a green signal, allowing the ego vehicle to continue on its path. Despite the signal to proceed, vigilance is necessary in anticipation of potential light changes.\n\nOn the right side of the roadway, there is a lineup of traffic cones indicating a lane closure or construction area. These cones necessitate that the ego vehicle stays in its lane, and it may need to reduce speed depending on the situation.\n\nComplementing the traffic cones, there are also temporary barriers situated on the right, which serve to further emphasize the lane restriction. These barriers help in guiding the traffic and preventing the ego vehicle from entering into possibly hazardous areas or zones that are off limits for vehicular traffic.\n\nNo other vulnerable road users, traffic signs, or miscellaneous objects within the scene affect the ego vehicle's driving decisions at this moment."
