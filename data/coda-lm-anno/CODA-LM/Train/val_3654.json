The cement mixer has an uneven shape, which is occasionally wider at the top than at the base, and it has visible moving parts and protrusions. The presence of this vehicle could indicate potential hazards such as the risk of falling debris or the possibility of the vehicle making sudden stops. Due to its size and the type of vehicle it is, it occupies most of the lane, which limits the maneuverability of the ego car. There are no other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image."

Its presence on the road indicates potential nearby construction activity. For the ego car, the driver should be vigilant and perhaps ready to reduce speed or change lanes if needed to avoid any potential hazards such as sudden stops or debris coming from the construction vehicle.",
