It is bright orange with a white horizontal strip, making it highly visible to drivers. Traffic cones are generally used to indicate areas where drivers should not pass, often due to road work, hazards, or changes in traffic patterns. In this scenario, the cone's placement suggests that the lane in which it is located is likely closed or restricted, prompting the driver of the ego car to adjust their driving path by staying in or switching to an open lane to continue traveling safely.",
