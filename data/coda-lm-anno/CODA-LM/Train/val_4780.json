            "description and explanation": "The object is a large wheel, likely part of a machinery or a decorative installation since it is unusually large to be a conventional vehicular tire. It comprises multiple spokes and a central hub, suggesting it might be designed for visual or mechanical purposes rather than actual vehicular use. For the ego car, this object does not pose any immediate impact on driving behavior since it is stationary and positioned off the road. However, it is crucial for the driver to remain attentive to possible nearby activities related to this object that might affect road conditions or introduce unexpected obstacles.",

It is stored outdoors and is typically used in construction or utility applications for electrical or telecommunications projects. Considering its placement near the road, it indicates industrial or construction activity in the vicinity. For the ego car, this object itself does not directly influence driving, but awareness of potential nearby construction activity is crucial as it may result in the presence of construction vehicles or temporary road signs affecting the driving conditions.",
