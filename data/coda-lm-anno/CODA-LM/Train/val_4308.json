Additionally, there is a pedestrian crossing sign located on the left side of the road. This sign serves as a warning to the ego vehicle to be vigilant and prepared to stop for pedestrians that could be crossing the road ahead. Alongside the red truck's lane, there are multiple orange traffic cones, which are set up to indicate a restricted area possibly due to road work or lane narrowing, prompting the autonomous car to maintain its lane and continue cautiously. Furthermore, there are concrete barriers present on the left, dividing the lanes of traffic from the oncoming lanes, which function to guide the vehicle to stay in its current lane and prevent accidental crossover into opposing traffic flow, consequently enhancing the safety on the road. Other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic lights, and other objects are not present in this image."
