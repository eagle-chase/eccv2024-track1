        "description and explanation": "In the observed scene, there is a large truck in front of the autonomous vehicle. This truck is immediately ahead, showing red taillights, which means it is either stopped or moving slowly. The presence of a concrete mixer drum identifies it as a construction vehicle. The size and positioning of this truck are critical as they limit the autonomous vehicle's ability to maneuver or change lanes, while the taillights signal the truck's current movement status. Additionally, there is a traffic light visible above and to the right side of the frame, displaying a red signal. This indicates that the autonomous vehicle, along with all other traffic, is required to come to a complete stop at the intersection. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene."
