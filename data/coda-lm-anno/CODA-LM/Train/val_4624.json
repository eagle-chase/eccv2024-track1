These vehicles are notably influencing the driving behavior since they reduce the usable width of the lane. This situation necessitates careful maneuvering by the ego car to navigate safely through the narrowed lane. Additionally, there are blue traffic cones with reflective strips lined up along the edge of the right lane. The placement of these cones signals that a part of the lane is obstructed or has been closed off for safe passage. This is likely due to the presence of the parked vehicles and possibly ongoing road works."
