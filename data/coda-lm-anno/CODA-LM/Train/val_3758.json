        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scenario, the ego car is following a large truck that is directly in front of it. The truck has flashing red lights and distinct rear safety markings, with a partially visible number plate. The presence and behavior of the truck have a notable impact on the ego car's decision-making; given the truck's size and its proximity on the road, overtaking or changing lanes would need to be executed with caution. Additionally, the flashing lights on the truck could be signalling a potential stop or slowdown for loading or unloading activities, warranting extra attention from the ego car.\n\nFurthermore, there is a traffic light in the distance which is currently green. This light permits vehicles in its lane to move forward. However, as the ego car will be approaching the light, it's crucial to stay alert for any change in the light's status which will necessitate a corresponding response.\n\nThe image does not contain any vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects that could affect the driving pattern of the ego vehicle."

            "description and explanation": "This object is the rear end of a large vehicle, likely a tow truck or commercial vehicle designed for hauling. It includes a visible license plate clearly displaying the registration, a white V-shaped mark which may be reflective for improved visibility, and several auxiliary lights. The construction and elements of this rear end, such as the lifting mechanism and protective metal bars, suggest it is equipped for towing operations. The presence of this vehicle directly in front of the ego car affects the following distance and speed that should be maintained. The ego car must allow extra space both for safety reasons and to anticipate possible sudden stops or maneuvers by the tow truck.",

Continuous monitoring of the truck's indicators and brake lights, along with readiness to respond to the traffic light's changes, is recommended. No overtaking should be attempted unless the truck's intentions are clear and it is safe to do so."
