Due to its size and position, it may obstruct the lane and slow down traffic, which would require the ego car to either slow down or change lanes to overtake.\n  - A white sedan is observed in the distance, traveling in the opposite direction of the ego car. This vehicle does not directly influence the ego car's immediate driving decisions but should be monitored for any sudden changes in behavior. \n\n- **Vulnerable Road Users:**\n  - A construction worker in high visibility orange clothing is standing on the right edge of the road. The presence of this worker suggests potential road work ahead, necessitating cautious driving.\n\n- **Traffic Cones:**\n  - A series of orange traffic cones are placed on the left side of the road, indicating a closed-off area. This suggests that lane closures or obstructions might be ahead, requiring the ego car to potentially merge to the right.\n\n- **Barriers:**\n  - Temporary construction barriers are positioned on the right side of the road, partially covered by snow. These barriers designate a construction zone, which typically has reduced speed limits and demands increased attentiveness from the ego car.\n\nThe image does not show any traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects."
