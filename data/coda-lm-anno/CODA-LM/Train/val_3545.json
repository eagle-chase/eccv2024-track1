The proximity and movement of this white car could potentially influence the ego car's decisions, particularly regarding lane changes or merging, as it may hinder the ego car's ability to safely execute these maneuvers.\n\nSecondly, there is a gray wall barrier situated on the right side of the road. This barrier impacts the ego car as it restricts the ability to move to the right. Consequently, the ego car is required to stay within its current lane and cannot maneuver to the right, ensuring safety and adherence to the road's limits.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects indicated in the image data that would affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
