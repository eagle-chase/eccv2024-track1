A large yellow construction vehicle is positioned on the right side of the road, partially obstructing the lane and oriented perpendicular to the road. This vehicle poses a significant obstacle as it occupies part of the lane and might require sudden movements or additional space due to potential active work.\n\nAn elderly man is sitting on a chair adjacent to the curb on the right side of the road. While he is not immediately on the road, his close proximity to the traffic lane poses a potential risk if he decides to stand or move towards the road.\n\nIn the background, a traffic light shows a yellow light, indicating that the light is about to change to red. This requires the driver to prepare to stop if it is safe to do so."
