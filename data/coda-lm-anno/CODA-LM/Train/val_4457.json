This truck is directly in front of the autonomous car and is partially blocking the lane. Due to the size and proximity of this truck, the view and movement options for the autonomous car are restricted which necessitates cautious driving. The car may need to adjust its speed or change direction because of the truck's presence.\n\nMoreover, in the distance, there is a red traffic light at an intersection. This light, currently red, indicates that the autonomous car is required to stop at the intersection once the truck ahead moves aside, assuming it does so before the light changes. No other vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or miscellaneous objects were reported in the provided image."
