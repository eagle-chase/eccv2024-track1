        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scenario, the notable presence is that of a traffic light. This particular traffic light is mounted on a portable stand situated at the center of the intersection. It is a standard traffic light with three sections: a red light at the top, a yellow light in the middle, and a green light at the bottom. Currently, the red light is illuminated. The red light serves as a directive for vehicles to stop and await the green signal before they can proceed. The placement of this traffic light on a portable stand in the middle of the intersection suggests that it is a temporary traffic control measure. This could imply that the regular traffic signals are out of operation or that there is a temporary need for additional traffic management in this area. Other potential road users like vehicles, vulnerable road users such as pedestrians or cyclists, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, and miscellaneous objects do not feature in this particular traffic scene, as indicated by the absence of data in their respective categories."

This traffic management device comprises three colored lights (red, yellow, and green) stacked vertically. The current visible light is green, which indicates that vehicles facing the light are permitted to proceed through the intersection or along the pathway where the light faces. This directs the ego car to continue moving forward or to commence movement if it was previously stopped, following the rules of the traffic light system to ensure safety and order on the road.",
