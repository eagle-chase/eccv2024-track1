The proximity of the parked car to the traveling lane requires the ego vehicle to slightly adjust its path to the left to ensure safe passage and avoid any potential collision.\n\nAdditionally, there are two pedestrians within the scene. One is walking close to the parked car and could be preparing to cross the street or enter the car, while another is actively crossing the street from right to left in front of the ego vehicle. The presence of these pedestrians means that the ego car must reduce its speed and remain vigilant to ensure their safety as they are directly affecting traffic movement.\n\nFurthermore, there are traffic signs visible on the right side of the road. One sign indicates a speed limit of 10 km/h, and another prohibits overtaking. These signs are important for the ego vehicle to comply with in order to adhere to traffic regulations and maintain safe driving conditions. \n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects identified in the image that impact the ego vehicle's driving behavior."
