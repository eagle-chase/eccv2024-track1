Their attire and actions imply they could be involved in roadwork or traffic management, which may present potential road hazards or instructions for drivers to follow. \n\nThere are no traffic signs visible in the immediate vicinity, meaning the ego car must depend on other environmental cues or road markings to navigate safely. Similarly, the absence of traffic lights in the current view requires the ego car to proceed with caution and be ready to respond to any directions from road workers or other forms of road control.\n\nReflective traffic cones are observed lining the right side of the road, indicating a boundary or lane closure and suggesting a reduction in the number of available lanes, necessitating a lane position adjustment by the ego car. Temporary barriers are also present on the right, likely signaling ongoing construction or a closed-off area, which may partially obstruct the road or impose restrictions that the ego car must adhere to.\n\nAdditionally, a dustbin covered with a tarp is seen to the right, which, although not directly in the driving path, serves as a reminder for the ego car to be vigilant for potential debris or unexpected obstacles, especially in poor weather conditions."
