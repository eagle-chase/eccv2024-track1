The reflective material improves visibility at night or in low-light conditions, prompting drivers to stay within their lanes or avoid specific sections of the road. As a consequence, the behavior of the ego car should involve maintaining a safe distance from the barrier and possibly slowing down if the barriers indicate upcoming road work or lane closures.",
