The truck's presence directly in front of the ego car influences driving behavior by necessitating a cautious approach and possibly a reduced speed. It may also limit the visibility ahead for the driver of the ego car, requiring them to increase their following distance to ensure safety, especially in heavy traffic or low visibility conditions. The truck's size and slower acceleration compared to smaller vehicles might also necessitate lane changes or adjustments in driving strategy to maintain a steady traffic flow.",
