This placement poses a significant obstruction to the ego vehicleâ€™s path, necessitating a potential lane change or speed adjustment to ensure safe navigation.\n\nAdditionally, a construction worker is present near the construction vehicle, donned in reflective clothing for visibility. The worker's presence on the road heightens the risk factor, demanding cautious maneuvering by the ego vehicle to guarantee safety.\n\nThe traffic scenario further involves a traffic light, displaying a red signal for the direction in which the ego car is headed, accompanied by a green left turn arrow. This configuration mandates that the ego vehicle comes to a halt, adhering to the red light, while simultaneously indicating that vehicles intending to turn left are granted the right of way.\n\nMoreover, temporary construction barriers have been erected encircling the work area on the right side of the road. These barriers serve as an indicator of an ongoing construction zone, signaling to vehicles the importance of maintaining a clear distance from the designated construction area.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects are reported in this image, suggesting a primary focus on the noted vehicles, road user, and infrastructure modifications due to construction activities."
