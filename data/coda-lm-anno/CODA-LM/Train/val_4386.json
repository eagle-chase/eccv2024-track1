The presence of this truck is significant as it could potentially lead to sudden movements or slowdowns due to its load, which would affect the flow of traffic. Consequently, there is a need for careful navigation around this truck. Additionally, a traffic light visible ahead shows a green light, indicating that the ego vehicle has the right to proceed. However, despite the green light, it's important for the ego car to stay alert for any changes in the light or unexpected behaviors from other road users. No other road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in the image."
