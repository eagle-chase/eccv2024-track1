Firstly, there is a large yellow bulldozer directly ahead of the ego car, carrying a load of snow or debris in its bucket. This construction machinery occupies both the right lane fully and part of the left lane, moving slowly and significantly impeding the forward progress of the ego car, necessitating a cautious approach or lane change. The use of at least two lanes by this vehicle increases the risk of side collisions if an attempt to overtake is made without due caution.\n\nAdditionally, multiple red brake lights from vehicles ahead in both lanes indicate a traffic slow down or stop. These illuminated brake lights suggest that the traffic flow is either stopping or considerably slowed, likely due to the operation of the construction equipment or other road conditions.\n\nA round, red 'Do Not Enter' traffic sign is visible on the left, facing another direction of traffic. Although this sign does not directly influence the ego car's immediate lane, its presence suggests nearby road restrictions that may increase congestion or necessitate detours.\n\nFinally, traffic lights at the intersection are showing red for all directions. The red lights indicate that the vehicles, including the ego car, must stop if they reach the intersection, thus affecting flow and necessitating a stop until the light changes to green."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle commonly used in roadwork and development projects. Characterized by its heavy-duty construction and yellow color, this vehicle is equipped with various attachments which can include shovels or buckets. Such vehicles are typically slow-moving and require careful navigation around them. For the ego car, this indicates the need to reduce speed and possibly change lanes if safe to do so, maintaining a safe distance to avoid any unexpected maneuvers by the construction vehicle.",

Avoid sudden lane changes or overtaking without a clear view of the adjacent lanes. Prepare to stop at the traffic light if approaching the intersection, observing traffic signals and the behavior of other vehicles. Overall, caution and patience are advised due to the construction activity and red traffic lights controlling the flow."
