The brightness of headlights impacts visibility and requires careful attention to the road and distance estimation. Additionally, a cyclist equipped with a rear light and side panniers is present in the center of the road, moving in the same direction as the ego car. It's important to observe the cyclist closely as they can change speed or direction suddenly, which is crucial for preventing accidents. Moreover, there are three consecutive triangular warning signs on the right side of the road, visible as yellow with a darker symbol. These signs generally indicate caution for potential hazards ahead, such as roadworks, merging lanes, or other disruptions."

The vehicle appears to be moving, as suggested by the light trails and the brightness of its headlights. In the given driving scenario, the presence of this car affects the driving behavior of the ego car by indicating potential traffic flow and the need for maintaining a safe following distance. It is crucial for predicting potential maneuvers by this car, such as changing lanes or slowing down, which directly impacts the ego car's driving decisions.",
