Firstly, there is a white Audi car directly in front of the ego vehicle, moving in the same direction. It is important to monitor this vehicle since its actions will have a direct impact on the driving decisions of the ego car, such as maintaining an appropriate speed and following distance.\n\nAdditionally, there is a silver van positioned ahead on the right, also moving along the same trajectory as the ego car. The presence of the van requires vigilance as it may necessitate the ego car to adjust its lane positioning or speed, especially if the van attempts to change lanes.\n\nThe traffic scenario also includes road signage indicating that there is a right turn or lane merging ahead due to road work, suggesting potential alterations in lane availability and traffic flow which might call for lane changing maneuvers or a reduction in speed.\n\nWhile there are no visible traffic lights present to control the traffic flow in this section of the road, the absence of vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists, lessens the need for immediate speed changes or abrupt stops, with the caveat that care must be taken in case they emerge unexpectedly.\n\nThe setup of orange traffic cones, along with temporary fencing and barriers on the right side of the road, is noticeable. These are demarcating the boundary for the ongoing road work, dictating that vehicles should steer clear of the affected lane and maintain travel in the left lane. This setup guides the traffic and reinforces the protection of the construction zone.\n\nFinally, the category for other objects is empty, indicating there are no additional items within the traffic image that affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."
