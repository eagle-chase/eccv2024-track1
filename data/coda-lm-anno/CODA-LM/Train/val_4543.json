        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there are multiple elements that affect the ego car's driving behavior. Several vehicles are present, including a tank truck and a black SUV. The tank truck is positioned in the right lane and is partially straddling the lane line, likely indicating some form of roadwork or cleaning operation. This requires the ego vehicle to be cautious in order to safely overtake or maintain its lane, as the truck's positioning may interfere with lane detection systems. Additionally, the presence of the black SUV directly in front of the ego vehicle demands that a safe following distance be maintained, as the ego car must react to the SUV's speed and braking.\n\nThere is also a vulnerable road user, a person in blue attire, seemingly a worker, positioned on the right side beyond the tank truck near the sidewalks. The worker's proximity to the roadway adds potential risk, requiring the ego vehicle to be ready to adjust its speed or switch lanes if needed to ensure safety.\n\nMoreover, traffic cones are present along the edge and partially into the lane on the right side of the road, beginning just ahead of the tank truck. These cones suggest an active roadwork area or a portion of the lane that is not in use, guiding the ego vehicle to maintain a position on the left side of its lane to avoid them.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects indicated in the data that influence the current driving conditions."

It is orange with a white reflective strip, making it highly visible to drivers. The cone is placed on the road, likely indicating that drivers should move slightly to the left to avoid an obstacle or to follow a modified lane arrangement.
