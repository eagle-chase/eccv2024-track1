The presence of this car requires the ego vehicle to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for possible braking or changes in the speed of the lead vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, a directional sign on the right side of the road, mounted on a pole above the roadside landscaping, indicates an upcoming right turn or exit. This sign suggests a junction ahead, prompting the ego vehicle to potentially change lanes or adjust speed if planning to take the exit.\n\nMoreover, multiple red traffic cones are placed in the right lane, starting on the road shoulder and occupying part of the lane. These cones indicate lane closure or road work ahead, signaling the necessity for a lane change to the left to avoid them."

If there's a need to exit right as indicated by the sign, the ego vehicle should start signaling early before changing lanes due to the traffic cones."
