It is easily noticeable by its large, illuminated rear lights and turning indicators. The presence of the truck is significant for the ego car's driving decisions because the truck may slow down or stop suddenly, which would require the ego car to react accordingly to maintain safety.\n\nAdditionally, there are green traffic lights visible ahead, which indicate that vehicles, including the ego car, are permitted to proceed in their current direction. The state of these traffic lights is crucial as it dictates whether the ego car can legally and safely continue moving forward. \n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
