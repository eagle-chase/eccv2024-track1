This parked van occupies part of the shoulder; therefore, caution must be taken to ensure a safe passing distance. Additionally, a large truck is directly ahead. It is loaded with large objects and equipment, occupying the right lane. Due to the truck's large load, it might obstruct views or cause unexpected lane changes or stops, necessitating increased monitoring from the ego car.\n\nA noticeable traffic sign is a yellow directional sign on the right, indicating a fork or merge ahead. This sign warns of upcoming road configuration changes, alerting the ego car to be prepared for potential changes in traffic patterns.\n\nOther notable elements include bare trees lining the road, with the visibility appearing reduced, likely due to weather conditions such as haze or fog. This reduced visibility requires the ego car to adopt slower speeds and heightened awareness of the surroundings."
