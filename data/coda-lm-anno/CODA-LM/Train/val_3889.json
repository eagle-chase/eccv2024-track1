These cones imply that the ego vehicle should reduce its speed and stay alert for possible detours, workers, or obstacles ahead. Other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, and other objects have not been reported in the scene, indicating that they are not present or relevant in this particular scenario."
