The truck is marked with the number '17.9' on its rear and is equipped with visible safety signals. Due to the truck's considerable size and the typically slow speed at which cement trucks travel, it is an important factor for the ego car's driving strategy. The presence of the truck directly ahead necessitates increased caution from the ego car, as it may have less time to react to the truck's movements."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, specifically identifiable as a cement mixer. It is characterized by its large rotating drum used for mixing cement components, situated at the back of the vehicle. This vehicle tends to move slower than typical traffic, which requires the ego car to possibly adapt its speed or lane position to ensure safe passage around the vehicle. Such a vehicle might also make unexpected stops or maneuvers related to construction activities, dictating a need for increased awareness and caution from nearby drivers, including adjusting the following distance.",

Continuous monitoring of the truck's signals and brake lights is necessary to respond promptly to any sudden stops or changes in the truck's speed. Additionally, the ego car should be prepared to change lanes if the opportunity arises and it is safe to do so, especially if the truck's pace significantly decreases."
