The truck is marked with reflective yellow and black stripes, signaling caution. The presence of this truck is significant as it may be slow-moving or stationary due to its operation, which directly affects the ego car's ability to proceed.\n\nAdditionally, multiple traffic lights are visible in the distance, with a green signal currently illuminated. This indicates that the flow of traffic is allowed to proceed through the intersection. However, the ego car must remain alert to the traffic light status, as it may need to stop if the signal changes to yellow or red by the time the vehicle reaches the intersection.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

Concrete mixer trucks are used for transporting freshly mixed concrete to construction sites.
