However, I observe a traffic light in the distance that is displaying a green light and is situated above the center of the roadway. This green light signals to the vehicles that they have the permission to continue their journey, which would affect our autonomous vehicle by allowing it to maintain its course forward. Additionally, there is a temporary road barrier with yellow and black stripes blocking the direct path of the ego vehicle. This suggests that there may be road work or some temporary obstruction ahead, necessitating that the autonomous car either comes to a stop or navigate around the barrier to proceed safely. There are no traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects affecting the driving conditions in the image."
