Firstly, there is a stationary orange forklift parked on the right side of the road, facing away from the direction of the ego car. Even though this forklift appears to be parked, it is important to consider that it could become an active participant on the road, potentially impacting the available drivable space. \n\nAdditionally, there is a vulnerable road user noted on the right side of the road, specifically a cyclist who is either preparing or repairing their bicycle. It is critical to be wary of this individual as they may unexpectedly enter the roadway or could potentially require assistance.\n\nRegarding traffic lights, the scene does not contain any visible traffic lights, indicating that there are no immediate traffic light controls affecting the ego carâ€™s behavior at this moment.\n\nLastly, the scene includes an obstruction on the sidewalk to the right, comprising a fence and layered advertising boards. This setup may obstruct the view, making it essential to proceed with caution, as there could be unsighted road users potentially entering the road from behind these obstructions.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image that require additional attention."
