        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are a few notable features related to road users and objects. Firstly, there is a green truck parked on the left side of the road with its back facing the ego car. This parked truck is currently stationary, but because of its proximity to the roadway, it could pose a potential hazard if it were to start moving unexpectedly. Alongside this, a yellow construction loader is also parked on the left side, facing the ego vehicle. The presence of the construction loader indicates that there may be roadwork ahead or a construction zone, suggesting that extra caution should be taken due to possible changes in traffic flow around the construction zone.\n\nAdditionally, a pile of debris or agricultural materials is located on the left side of the road just past the construction loader. This material is considered a risk, as part of it may obstruct the roadway if it spills over or is scattered, presenting a danger to vehicles.\n\nThere were no other objects or road users such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers identified in the image. The road dynamics and environment suggested by these observations would require an autonomous vehicle to navigate with heightened awareness and caution."

It is equipped with a large front bucket that is used for moving or loading heavy materials such as dirt, sand, or gravel.

It is smaller and less stable than a car, which makes it vulnerable on the road. For the ego car, recognizing a tricycle nearby implies the need for enhanced vigilance and potentially slowing down to ensure the safety of all road users. The ego car should also maintain a safe distance from the tricycle to avoid any accidents, especially since tricycles can have unpredictable movement patterns and might not adhere strictly to traffic rules.",
