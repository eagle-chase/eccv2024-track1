However, there is one pedestrian noticed on the right sidewalk, who is wearing dark clothing and walking away from the road. Although this pedestrian does not pose an immediate threat to the ego car's path, careful monitoring is advised in case they decide to cross the road unexpectedly, which could influence the driving behavior. \n\nThe traffic image also includes a traffic sign, specifically a blue street name sign positioned on the right side of the road. This sign is primarily useful for navigation purposes and does not have a direct impact on the immediate driving decisions of the ego car. Additionally, there are no traffic lights in the current view, indicating that there are no immediate signals from traffic lights affecting the driving decisions at this moment.\n\nIn terms of road safety measures, several black and yellow traffic cones are placed on the edges of the road. These cones serve to guide the traffic flow and highlight areas of the road that might be narrower or require additional caution, thus subtly influencing the driving path and behavior.\n\nLastly, no barriers are visible that impact the road's usability, and there are no significant other objects observed that would necessitate a change in driving decisions. The absence of visible barriers means there's no immediate restriction in the road layout that demands attention, and similarly, the lack of significant other objects like debris, animals, or unusual obstacles allows for straightforward driving without additional concerns."
