        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are several vehicles noted which influence the driving behavior of the ego vehicle. Firstly, a concrete mixer truck is positioned on the left lane ahead of the ego vehicle. Due to its size, this truck could potentially obscure visibility and its unpredictable maneuvers may require the ego vehicle to maintain a safe distance. Secondly, a red bus is seen on the middle lane to the right of the ego vehicle, moving in the same direction. The bus may stop abruptly or let passengers off, which necessitates extra caution and readiness to brake. Lastly, a gray sedan is observed on the far right lane, slightly ahead of the ego vehicle. The presence of this sedan requires increased awareness as it might change lanes or adjust its speed, thereby affecting the planned path of the ego vehicle. No other road users such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in this scenario."
