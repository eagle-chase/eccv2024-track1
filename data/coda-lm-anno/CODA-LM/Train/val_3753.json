Additionally, there is a white bus traveling in the same direction, but on the far left lane. Considering buses can stop frequently, there may be a need for the ego car to alter its speed or switch lanes depending on the bus's actions.\n\nOn the right, there are directional road signs, hinting at a turning lane and possibly a roundabout or intersection ahead, assisting in navigation decisions. However, traffic lights are not visible in the current view, so the ego car has to rely on standard right-of-way rules and exercise caution at any crossings.\n\nOrange traffic cones are lined up on the right, indicating a construction zone or lane closure, thus the ego car will need to steer left to avoid the restricted area. Near those cones, there's temporary fencing and barriers signifying ongoing construction work, meaning the ego car must keep its distance and may need to reduce speed.\n\nLastly, dustbins are observed lined along the curbside behind the traffic cones. Since proximity to the lane means they could become hazards if they enter the roadway, it is crucial for the ego car to monitor these objects carefully."
