        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are two pedestrians on the right side walking towards a building entrance, with one of them wearing high-visibility clothing. Their proximity to the roadway may affect the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle, as they could potentially cross or enter the vehicle's path. Additionally, there is a metal railing along the right side of the roadway adjacent to the building, which serves as a barrier delineating the boundary between the roadway and the pedestrian area. This is important for the vehicle to recognize in order to maintain its lane and navigate safely. Lastly, there is a large building on the right with active interior lighting and additional road illumination from an external light source. The lighting from the building could cause distractions or visibility issues for the vehicle's sensors and the driver, especially if there are reflections on wet surfaces. There are no vehicles, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the image that impact the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle."
