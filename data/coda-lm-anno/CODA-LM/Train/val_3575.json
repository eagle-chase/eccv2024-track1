        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a variety of road users and objects that inform the driving behavior of the ego car. Starting with vehicles, there's a black sedan parked on the right side of the road that is slightly protruding into the traffic lane. This sedan might obstruct the flow of traffic, potentially making it necessary for the ego car to navigate around it or change lanes. In addition, there are orange utility vehicles parked ahead of the sedan on the right side. These vehicles are equipped with machinery that extends into the traffic lane, posing a more considerable obstruction that necessitates a lane change by the ego car in advance for safe travel.\n\nFurthermore, there are two cyclists who are sharing the lane with the ego car, riding next to each other in the middle of the lane. The presence of these cyclists requires the ego car to reduce speed and consider a safe method to pass them, including a lane change if the opposite lane is clear of incoming traffic.\n\nAdditionally, there's a traffic sign that reads \"Tiān Lù binisét\" hanging over the street on the right side, signifying the presence of local businesses. Although this traffic sign doesn't directly affect the immediate driving behavior, it suggests there could be increased pedestrian and vehicle activity in the area.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that would impact the ego car's driving decisions."
