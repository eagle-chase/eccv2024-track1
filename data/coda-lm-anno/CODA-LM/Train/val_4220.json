This suggests that they are either moving or are ready to move shortly. The presence of these vehicles is crucial for the ego car's driving behavior, as these cars can suddenly stop or slow down, necessitating the ego car to adjust its speed and maintain a safe following distance accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic light in the forefront of the view, which is currently green. This green light signals that the ego car has the clearance to proceed. However, it's important for the ego car to stay vigilant and be prepared for any potential changes in the light's status as it continues to move forward.\n\nNo other road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or objects are mentioned, indicating that they are not present in this specific traffic scenario."
