The presence of this construction vehicle is significant as it completely obstructs the ego car's path, necessitating a change of lanes in order for the vehicle to continue its journey.\n\nAdjacent to this setting, there is a traffic sign indicating that a right turn is mandatory. It is located on the right side of the road above the green traffic light. The implication of the sign is that the ego car, which is situated in the lane under this sign, is obliged to turn right to comply with traffic regulations.\n\nFurther complementing the traffic sign, there is a green traffic light placed directly ahead on the right side above the road. This green light authorizes the vehicles facing it to proceed with the caveat that the movement is restricted to right turns only, in alignment with the sign for the current lane of the ego car."
