The presence of the police car suggests an emergency or a roadblock scenario, and the flashing lights serve as an indicator of official activities, potentially impacting the flow and speed of traffic.\n\nAdditionally, illuminated arrow signs located before the roadwork barriers indicate that the left lane is closed. These signs instruct drivers to merge to the right lane, thereby necessitating a lane change for continuing traffic flow and reducing the lane availability.\n\nOrange traffic cones are lined up to mark the boundary between the construction area and the part of the road that is open for traffic. They serve to alert drivers of changes in road layout and act as a physical barrier to prevent vehicles from entering potentially dangerous areas.\n\nMoreover, there are sizeable, temporary roadwork barriers on the right side of the road enclosing an area where work is likely happening. These barriers convey to drivers that there is ongoing roadwork or construction, prompting them to slow down or move away from the barriers to maintain safety."
