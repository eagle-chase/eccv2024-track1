The first is a white car situated in the right lane ahead of the ego vehicle, moving in the same direction. This white car holds significance for the ego car's immediate driving decisions as its speed and movements require close attention for speed regulation and maintaining a safe following distance. The second is a red car parked on the left side of the road. Although not an immediate concern for the ego car's travel path, it must be monitored for any sudden activity, such as the vehicle starting to move or a door opening.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic sign of interest: a yellow diamond-shaped warning on the right, indicating a road curve ahead or another condition that necessitates caution. This sign is pertinent as it informs the ego car's speed management strategy, indicating that it may need to adjust speed accordingly to safely navigate the upcoming curve.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in this scene that impact the driving behavior of the ego car."
