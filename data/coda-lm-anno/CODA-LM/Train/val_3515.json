        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there is a single vehicle present on the road. The vehicle is a large utility vehicle with beige and red coloring and is equipped with a mounted crane or lifting device. This vehicle is positioned directly in front of the ego car and is occupying the same lane of travel. The presence of this utility vehicle is significant as it may be moving at a slower pace due to its operational function. Consequently, this could impact the driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating a lower travel speed to maintain a safe following distance. Additionally, the ego car may need to evaluate the possibility of safely overtaking the utility vehicle if it affects the flow of traffic.\n\nThere are no other road users such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene. Hence, these categories are not considered in the summary of the current traffic situation."

It has several articulated arms, possibly for tasks like excavation or hydraulic lifting. Its presence on this part of the road may suggest ongoing construction or repair work nearby which could affect traffic flow.

If conditions permit and it is legally allowed, consider changing lanes to overtake the utility vehicle safely when it is safe to do so."
