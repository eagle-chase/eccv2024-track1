Its bulky size limits visibility for the driver of the ego car and presents a potential hazard, as it may stop or slow down unexpectedly, requiring the ego car to exercise increased caution. Additionally, several other cars are present around the ego car, with a white car positioned slightly ahead to the right. The movements of these cars are an integral part of traffic flow and can affect the driving behavior of the ego car in terms of lane changes and speed adjustments. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers or other objects reported in the image that affect driving conditions."
