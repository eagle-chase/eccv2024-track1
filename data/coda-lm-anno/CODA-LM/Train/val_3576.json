They also pose a risk of sudden hazards if drivers or passengers open doors or move around the parked vehicles."

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, parked vehicles can be seen lining both sides of the road. The majority are parked on the right. These vehicles are particularly noticeable because their reflective surfaces are brightly illuminated by the low light conditions. The presence of these parked vehicles reduces the available driving space on the road, which may force the driving car to move cautiously and more closely monitor the situation. This is critical as there is a risk that vehicle occupants could open doors unexpectedly or move around the cars, creating sudden hazards.\n\nAdditionally, the lighting conditions in this image are poor and inconsistent. Some areas are well-lit by streetlights, while others remain in relative darkness. The variability in lighting can cause a reduction in visibility, making it harder for the autonomous driving system to detect road users and obstacles in time. This can result in slower reaction times when it comes to identifying changes in the road environment or the movements of other road users. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers reported in the image."

Additionally, the headlights should be fully operational to improve visibility, and attention should be heightened for unforeseen obstacles or movements from the sides of the road."
