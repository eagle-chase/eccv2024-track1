This van, which is in an adjacent lane, could potentially impact the driving decisions of the ego vehicle, such as when turning or changing lanes. Additionally, there are overhead directional signs displaying routes and directions. These signs are essential for navigation, helping the driver of the ego vehicle as well as others to determine the correct lane for their intended route. Furthermore, there is a green traffic light ahead, indicating that the ego vehicle has the right of way and may proceed straight or turn if it's legal to do so without needing to stop. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present that affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle in this scene."
