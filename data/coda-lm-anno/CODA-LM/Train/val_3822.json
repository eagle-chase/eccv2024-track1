However, there is a vulnerable road user, specifically a cyclist, who is slightly ahead of the ego car, on the right side of the lane, crossing the street. The cyclist is moving from the right to the left side of the road, which directly influences the driving behavior of the ego car. The ego car must take into account the safety of the cyclist, who poses a potential hazard while crossing the street.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic light ahead that is currently red. This red light requires the ego car, along with any other vehicles, to stop and wait until the light turns green before proceeding through the intersection.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects affecting the driving conditions in the image."
