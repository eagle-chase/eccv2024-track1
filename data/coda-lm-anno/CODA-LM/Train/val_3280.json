        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are two notable categories of road users: vehicles and other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects are not present.\n\nThe first category, vehicles, includes a parked car with a trailer attached on the left side of the ego car. This vehicle is partially obstructing the driving path, necessitating careful maneuvering by the ego car to avoid a collision. The vehicle is parked in such a manner that it narrows the driving lane for the ego car.\n\nAdditionally, there are two cars parked on the right side of the road. These vehicles are close to each other and parallel to the curb. Their positioning reduces the available road width, requiring the ego car to steer slightly to the left to maintain a safe distance from them.\n\nIn summary, the traffic image shows a scenario where parked vehicles on both sides of the road impact the driving behavior of the ego car, demanding cautious navigation to ensure safety."
