        "description and explanation": "The scene includes a large truck directly in front of the ego car, which is obstructing much of the view ahead. The truck is a cement mixer with a visible registration plate AV1539. It's large, with a cylindrical mixing drum and various operational machinery, characterized by dusty and worn surfaces. This presence of the truck is critical as it limits the visibility ahead for the ego car and is likely to affect maneuvering choices because of its considerable size and the potential for slower movement during cement mixing.\n\nAdditionally, there's a traffic light within sight to the right and above the traffic scene, showing green. The green light signals that the ego car is allowed and expected to proceed. However, extra caution is warranted due to the truck occupying the lane in front of the ego car. There are no other road users such as vulnerable road users, no traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the scene that affect driving conditions."

Its presence directly ahead on the road indicates that the ego vehicle should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential stops or slow movement. Such vehicles often make frequent stops or unexpected maneuvers, especially near construction sites, which requires heightened attention and caution from the ego vehicle's driver.",

Also, check the truck's turn signals for any indications of a lane change or turn, and adjust the ego car's positioning accordingly. Keep monitoring the traffic light in case it changes to yellow or red."
