        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scenario, two vehicles are present. A white van is observed traveling directly ahead of the ego car, only partly visible due to the short distance separating them. It is significant to note the white van's position and movement, as it influences the ego car's capability to safely accelerate or maneuver into different lanes.\n\nAdditionally, there is a green industrial truck positioned slightly ahead to the left of the ego car. The presence of the green truck causes a visual obstruction and carries the potential for unforeseen movements, both of which are essential factors for the ego car's navigation and decision-making process.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are noted in the image, indicating that none of these elements play a role in this particular driving context."
