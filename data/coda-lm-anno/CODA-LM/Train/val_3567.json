The first one is a vehicle, specifically a white sedan that's directly ahead on the same lane as the ego car. The sedan's brake lights are illuminated, which may indicate that it is either slowing down or has come to a complete stop. This situation directly affects the driving behavior of the ego car, as it necessitates maintaining a safe following distance and being prepared to stop to avoid any potential collision.\n\nAdditionally, there's an object on the road ahead, located on the same lane as both the ego car and the white sedan. The object resembles a box. This presence poses a potential obstacle for the ego car, which might necessitate a change of lanes or coming to a stop to safely navigate around it if it obstructs the vehicle's path.\n\nNo other road users such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are noted in the image, suggesting a relatively clear road environment aside from the mentioned vehicle and object."
