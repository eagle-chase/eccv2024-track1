The proximity of these vehicles necessitates that the ego car remain vigilant and ready to make speed adjustments or change positions as needed. Additionally, there is a motorcyclist located to the left of the ego car, who is wearing a grey jacket and appears to be at an angle, signaling that they might be considering a lane change or other maneuvering actions. Due to this, the ego car must continuously monitor the motorcyclist to prevent any potential collision. No traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in the scene."

Due to its larger size and slower speed compared to typical two-wheeled motorcycles, the tri-cycle can affect traffic flow by moving slowly and necessitating caution from surrounding vehicles. Drivers should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential sudden stops or slower acceleration from such vehicles.",
