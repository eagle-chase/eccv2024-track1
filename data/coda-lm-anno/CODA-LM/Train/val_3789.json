The ego car needs to be cautious of the oncoming headlights to avoid glare and maintain clear visibility by focusing on the lane demarcations. Additionally, there are red tail lights of vehicles ahead in the same lane, suggesting the traffic is slow or stopped. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to slow down or stop, paying attention to the brake lights of the vehicles ahead. Furthermore, an animal, possibly a cat, is crossing the road in front of the ego car.
