However, there is a traffic light visible on the right side of the road at the corner of the intersection, which is emitting a bright white light. This light is likely indicating a crosswalk signal or a specialized traffic signal.

Cyclists can affect driving decisions significantly as they move at different speeds than motorized vehicles and share the same roadway. The presence of a cyclist requires the ego car to maintain a safe distance and possibly adjust speed or change lanes to avoid too close proximity. It is also important for the ego car to continuously monitor the cyclist's movements as cyclists can sometimes shift direction or stop more suddenly than cars.",
