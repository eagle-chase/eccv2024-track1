It is identified by its visible mixing drum and appears to be slightly skewing towards the left side of its lane. The presence of the truck may reduce visibility ahead for the ego car and could introduce potential hazards, especially if the truck makes unexpected movements or comes to an abrupt stop.\n\nAdditionally, there are a couple of trees situated on the roadside. These trees are well-maintained and do not interfere with the traffic flow. While they do not present an immediate risk or restriction to the vehicle's path, it is advisable to monitor for any debris that might fall onto the road during windy conditions.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the scene that need to be taken into consideration."

This vehicle typically moves slower and may make frequent stops, especially at construction sites. Its presence indicates ongoing construction nearby. The ego car must maintain a safe following distance and be ready for potential stops or slow movement from this construction vehicle. It is crucial to be cautious and patient while driving behind or near this type of heavy machinery due to its size and operational requirements.",

In this context, the bollard might be used to guide traffic flow and prevent vehicles from swerving off the road or into a nearby property. For the ego car, it acts as a marker to maintain proper lane discipline and avoid driving into restricted or unsafe areas.",
