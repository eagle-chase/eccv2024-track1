They may contain local information or instructions that are relevant to road users.\n\nFurthermore, a metal guardrail is present along the right side of the road, delineating the boundary between the road and a dropped area adjacent to it. This guardrail serves as a critical safety feature, indicating that the ego vehicle must maintain a safe distance to avoid any hazards.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects present in the image that would affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."
