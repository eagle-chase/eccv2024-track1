Due to its size and the risk of debris falling from it, the ego car needs to maintain an increased following distance and exercise caution. Additionally, multiple passenger vehicles are visible on the road with their brake lights on, indicating that traffic is either slowing down or stopping. This suggests that the ego car must be prepared to reduce its speed and maintain a safe following distance.\n\nA red traffic light is directly in front of the ego car, requiring the ego car to stop and wait for the light to turn green before proceeding.\n\nFinally, there is potential glare from lights which could obstruct the driver's vision. The ego car should ensure that its sensors and the driver maintain clear visibility despite the glare."

For the ego car, this type of vehicle poses an important consideration due to its slow acceleration, wide turns, and possible stops at construction sites. Caution is required when driving near this vehicle as sudden movements, such as turning or stopping to unload materials, could affect the driving decisions and path planning for the ego car.",
