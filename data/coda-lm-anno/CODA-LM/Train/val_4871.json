Even though it's not moving currently, it's important to keep an eye on it since there's a possibility that it might start moving or passengers could disembark, creating potential risks. Additionally, on the right side of the road, there are large industrial cable reels stored close to the driving path. These need to be considered with caution even though they aren't blocking the road, as they could roll onto the roadway or hinder visibility. Other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, and barriers are not present in the scene."

For the future driving behavior of the ego car, if this object were to be closer to or obstructing the roadway, extra caution would be needed to navigate safely.
