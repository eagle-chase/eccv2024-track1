The yellow car is positioned in a way that it is half into the lane of the ego car and half in the parking zone. The location of the yellow car is significant as it affects the driving path of the ego car, potentially necessitating a change of lanes or a reduction in speed to prevent a collision.\n\nAdditionally, there is a large blue billboard that is partly blocking the view ahead on the right side, which seems to be close to or on the roadway. This billboard poses a hazard because it reduces visibility, concealing any other road users who might be approaching from the right, thereby increasing the risk of an incident involving the ego vehicle."

It is smaller and moves at a slower pace compared to standard four-wheeled vehicles. For future driving behavior of the ego car, awareness of such tricycles is essential as they can affect the traffic flow and require careful overtaking maneuvers due to their slower speed and potential unpredictability in movement.",
