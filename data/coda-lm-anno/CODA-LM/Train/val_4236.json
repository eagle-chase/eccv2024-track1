Additionally, a tank truck is moving through the intersection directly ahead of the ego car, which could affect the car's maneuverability and decision-making depending on the truck's speed and direction.\n\nAmong vulnerable road users, construction workers are visible on the right side near construction machinery and barriers. Their proximity to the street poses a safety risk, as they might unexpectedly move into the roadway, requiring the ego car to exercise heightened caution.\n\nThe traffic signs include one indicating construction work ahead, visible to the lower left in front of the ego vehicle. This alerts the ego car to possible hazards and changes in road conditions necessitating reduced speed and increased alertness.\n\nThere is a traffic light directly above the intersection showing a red signal for the direction the ego car is facing, indicating that the ego car must stop and wait for the signal to change before proceeding legally and safely.\n\nTemporary metal barriers are present on the right side, demarcating the construction area. These barriers help control the traffic flow and restrict access to the construction zone, ensuring safety around potentially dangerous areas."
