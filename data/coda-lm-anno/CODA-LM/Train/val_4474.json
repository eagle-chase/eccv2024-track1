Additionally, there are large industrial cable reels and containers on the side of the road, associated with a perpendicularly parked car.

These items are generally found in industrial or construction areas where large amounts of cabling need to be managed and stored systematically. From the perspective of the ego car in this traffic scenario, this object being located off the side of the roadway indicates a nearby industrial site. Although it does not pose an immediate obstacle on the road, its presence suggests the possibility of heavy vehicle traffic entering or exiting the area, which requires heightened awareness and perhaps a slower speed from the driver to accommodate potential hazards.",
