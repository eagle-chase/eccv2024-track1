Additionally, multiple traffic signs are present, including a digital display with red text that may convey important information or warnings for drivers. The content on this sign could affect the decision-making of the autonomous driving system.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users or traffic lights indicated in the image.\n\nWhite and red traffic cones are positioned on the side of the road, signaling an area that requires caution or where driving access may be restricted. These cones imply there might be road work or other reasons to drive carefully, affecting the ego car's speed and movement. Wood and metal barriers are also present beside the road, suggesting construction or restricted pedestrian areas. These barriers could influence lane availability and necessitate the ego car to be prepared for changes in traffic flow or unexpected obstacles.\n\nOther objects along the roadside include a dustbin and some unused traffic signs leaning against the barriers. Although these are not in the direct path of the ego car, they could become hazards if they are moved by strong winds or other unforeseen events, impacting the safety of the road."
