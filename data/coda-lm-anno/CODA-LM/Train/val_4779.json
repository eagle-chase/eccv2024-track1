        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several notable elements to mention. Firstly, a large yellow mobile crane mounted on a white truck commands attention on the right side of the road. The crane, which exhibits the label 'AZZ2XCMG599,' is significant in size and its potential movement could influence the flow of traffic and the visibility for other vehicles, thus necessitating extra caution from drivers. Secondly, a white SUV is observed just ahead of the autonomous car, on the left, traveling in the same direction. The fact that it is traveling in close proximity and in the same lane as the autonomous car means that adjustments to the speed and lane choice might be needed to maintain safety.\n\nAdditionally, the scene includes a non-vehicle element: a dark metal fence is situated to the left of the road. It runs parallel to the roadside, signifying a boundary, and it may be adjacent to a pedestrian path, even though no pedestrians are currently visible.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists in the image. Similarly, there are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present that would impact the autonomous car's driving decisions in this instance."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a large construction vehicle mounted on a flatbed truck. It includes components like a crane, typically used for construction tasks like lifting heavy materials. The presence of this type of vehicle on the road usually indicates nearby construction activities. For the ego car, this means it may need to drive cautiously, possibly adjusting speed and maintaining a safe distance to avoid any unexpected movements from the construction vehicle as it may execute turns or stops depending on its destination or current activity.",
