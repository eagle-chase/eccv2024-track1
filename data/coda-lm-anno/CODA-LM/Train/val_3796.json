This presence requires careful attention since it significantly restricts the autonomous vehicle's ability to maneuver. This could lead to reduced visibility and might necessitate the autonomous car to slow down or change lanes.\n\nAdditionally, there is a pedestrian on the sidewalk to the right of the road, moving in the same direction as the traffic. Although the pedestrian is not in the street, the autonomous car needs to monitor them continuously to anticipate any potential attempt to cross the road unexpectedly.\n\nOn the roadside, there is a green road sign providing direction and distance information for various destinations, located past where the pedestrian is walking. This traffic sign is a part of the environment that is relevant for navigation purposes but doesn't require any immediate action from the autonomous vehicle as it doesn't affect immediate driving requirements.\n\nThe view includes several traffic lights; those that are applicable to the autonomous car's lane display a green light. This signal implies that the car is free to proceed. However, the vehicle must still be cautious because of the movement of the large construction vehicle ahead.\n\nThere are no traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle."
