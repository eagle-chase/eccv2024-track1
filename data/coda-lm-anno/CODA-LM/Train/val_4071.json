These cones reduce the drivable area of the road, marking out safe lanes for driving and signaling the presence of construction works or temporary obstacles.\n\n2. **Barriers**: Concrete barriers with striped patterns are positioned on a section of the road on the left side, extending into the driving lane. These barriers demarcate construction zones or delineate changes in traffic patterns, reducing the width of the driving lane and potentially obstructing usual traffic flow.\n\n3. **Other Objects**: Snow is visible on the surface of the road, suggesting slippery conditions.

            "description and explanation": "This object is a traffic cone. It is a cone-shaped marker that is primarily used to direct traffic and indicate areas where vehicles should not enter or where caution should be exercised. Due to its highly visible color, often orange with a reflective strip, it serves as an effective signal in low visibility conditions, such as during nighttime or poor weather conditions. The presence of this cone suggests there might be road work, an accident ahead, or a part of the lane that is closed for traffic. Therefore, the ego car should slow down and be prepared to adjust its route or stop if necessary.",

Given the lowered visibility and road conditions, increased following distance and reduced speed are recommended for safety."
