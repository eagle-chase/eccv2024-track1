It is carrying a cargo container and is partially illuminated by streetlight, casting shadows on the road. The truck is a significant obstacle for the ego vehicle, demanding a navigational decision. The absence of tail lights or indicators implies that it might be parked, which introduces a level of unpredictability regarding its future movements. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a large commercial vehicle commonly referred to as a truck. It is a heavy-duty transportation vehicle used primarily for carrying goods and materials. The presence of this truck on the road indicates that it may be in the process of delivery or transportation of items, which can influence the driving behavior of nearby vehicles, including the ego car. The ego car may need to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential slow movement or sudden stops from the truck, especially if it is actively loading or unloading goods.",

Using vehicle signals to indicate a lane change is advised to alert other road users of the maneuver. Continued vigilance for any sudden changes, such as movements from the parked truck, is critical. Enhanced observation for any hidden road signs or additional obstructions occluded by the truck's large profile is also recommended."
