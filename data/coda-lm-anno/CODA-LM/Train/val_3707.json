This vehicle is not directly affecting the ego car's path but should be monitored for any potential lane changes or effects on traffic flow. Additionally, a cyclist is present on the right side, riding alongside the traffic cones and near the carriageway. The proximity of the cyclist to the driving lane necessitates increased caution from the ego car to maintain a safe distance and be ready for any sudden movements. Furthermore, a line of traffic cones is set up across the middle of the image, delineating the lanes and possibly indicating a construction zone. These cones require the ego car to adhere to its lane and be alert for changes in lane conditions. There are no traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects affecting the driving conditions in the image."

It is designed to be highly visible with white and orange stripes, which are standard colors used for road safety to ensure they are detectable from a distance by drivers. The barrier's purpose is to guide traffic safely around construction sites, accidents or other road obstructions. In the context of driving behavior, the presence of this barrier indicates that the ego car should stay within the designated driving lanes and possibly reduce speed, depending on the density and positioning of the barriers along the road.",
