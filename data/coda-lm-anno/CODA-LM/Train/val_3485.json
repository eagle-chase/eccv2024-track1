However, we do observe vulnerable road users, which consist of pedestrians situated at what seems to be a bus stop, both sitting and standing by the roadside. Given their close proximity to the road, there's a risk they may step onto the road unexpectedly, which would require the ego vehicle to be vigilant and prepared to respond accordingly.\n\nIn addition to the pedestrians, there's a set of temporary construction barriers located on the right side of the lane of travel. These barriers are directing the flow of traffic towards the left, causing a potential restriction in the driveable area of the roadway. It is imperative for the autonomous vehicle to approach this set-up with caution, reducing speed and maintaining a safe distance from the barriers to ensure safe passage."
