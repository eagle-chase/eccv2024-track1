On the left side of the road, there is a white van parked horizontally, which might obstruct part of the lane, suggesting that the ego car would need to navigate around it with caution. Additionally, there is a dark-colored car parked on the right, parallel to the road. While this car is not currently obstructing the lane, there is a potential risk if the car were to enter the roadway abruptly, necessitating vigilance. Also present on the side of the road are large cable spools. These do not interfere with the current driving path, but caution is advised as they could become a potential hazard if they were to shift or roll onto the road. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers indicated in the current image data."

Positioned off the road, it is visible to the driver of the ego car. While it does not directly obstruct the roadway, its presence near the roadside indicates that there might be industrial or construction activity nearby, which could influence traffic patterns or potentially result in unexpected obstacles or personnel on or near the road. The ego car's driver should remain alert for any signs of construction and adjust speed accordingly, maintaining vigilance for any potential hazards that might emerge from the area where the spool is stored.",
