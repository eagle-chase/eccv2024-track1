        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a large blue truck directly in front of the ego car, occupying most of the lane. The truck is distinguishable by the text and graphics on its back. Due to the truck's size and proximity, the ego car's visibility and maneuverability are significantly limited. As a result, the autonomous driving system must adjust the vehicle's speed carefully and remain vigilant for any sudden stops or turns that the truck may make. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, identified by its robust structure and the visible equipment attached to its rear, typically used for heavy-duty tasks such as lifting, digging, or transportation of construction materials. The presence of this vehicle on the road suggests that there may be ongoing construction work nearby, which could lead to potential road obstructions or temporary traffic reroutes. The ego car needs to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for sudden stops or reduced speed zones. Additionally, the driver should be vigilant for any construction signs or workers directing traffic.",
