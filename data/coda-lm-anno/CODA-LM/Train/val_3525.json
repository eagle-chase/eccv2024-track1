The presence of this sedan is critical as it establishes the gap to be maintained by our car as well as any necessary speed modifications to ensure a safe following distance.\n\nOverhead directional signs cast in blue are also observed, which provide guidance on exits or specific lanes leading to various destinations. While these signs furnish helpful routing information, they do not compel an immediate reaction from our car unless a lane change is warranted for an upcoming exit.\n\nAccompanying the scene are orange traffic cones alongside temporary yellow barriers situated on the right-hand side of the road. Their presence indicates a lane narrowing, likely caused by road works or hazards, and mandates that our vehicle stays clear of them to prevent collisions and travel safely.\n\nIn addition, permanent concrete barriers are erected on both sides of the highway. These barriers are a critical safety feature, confining the drivable space and ensuring that vehicles, including the autonomous car, remain on the road.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or additional objects are present in this image, which simplifies the driving scenario for the autonomous vehicle."
