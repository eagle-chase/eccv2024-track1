These vehicles are important for the ego car's driving decisions, as they dictate potential lane changes and speed adjustments. It is essential for the ego car to keep a safe distance from these vehicles and observe their speed and turn signals to prevent collisions and ensure smooth traffic flow.\n\nAdditionally, there is an overhead gantry sign indicating that there are toll booth lanes ahead. This information is crucial for the ego car to prepare for the toll booths by slowing down, stopping for payment, or choosing the correct lane if equipped for electronic toll collection.\n\nThe right-most lane is partially narrowed by bright orange traffic cones, signaling that the lane may be closed or hazardous. The ego car must avoid this lane and be vigilant for traffic that may merge from this lane into the adjacent lanes.\n\nFurthermore, yellow and red plastic barriers are present along the right edge of the road. These barriers are in place to guide the traffic flow, indicate lane separations, and ensure safety by enforcing lane discipline. The ego vehicle is required to stay in its lane and follow the path outlined by these barriers.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects reported in the image."
