It occupies most of the lane width, which limits the ego car's ability to maneuver around it. The size and position of the construction vehicle have a direct impact on the ego car's options for passing or changing lanes. Furthermore, any sudden stops or turns by the transport vehicle carrying the excavator could influence the driving decisions of the ego car. There are no other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving environment."

It is loaded on the back of a trailer, indicating that it is being transported to or from a construction site. This presence impacts the driving behavior as it necessitates maintaining a safe following distance to avoid any potential hazards from the construction equipment, such as debris falling off or sudden stops by the transporting vehicle.",

The ego car should also be prepared for any potential road work indicated by the presence of the construction vehicle and adjust speed and following distance accordingly. Passing or lane changing should only be attempted if there is ample space and it is safe to do so."
