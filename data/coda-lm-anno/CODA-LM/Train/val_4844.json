        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are two notable vehicles. The first is a bus positioned ahead in the right lane, which can be identified by its illuminated rear lights, signifying that it's either coming to a stop or moving slowly. The presence of this bus is particularly impactful on traffic flow as it necessitates either a speed adjustment or a lane change from our vehicle to ensure a safe following distance. Additionally, there is a car parked at the roadside, concealed under a tarp. This parked car might limit visibility for our vehicle and other road users, potentially leading to hazards if any obstacles emerge from the area that the car obscures. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects mentioned in the image, suggesting a relative simplicity in the current traffic environment aside from the vehicles specified."

These cones are often bright orange with white bands for high visibility. In this driving scenario, the presence of the traffic cone can guide the ego car on its path, indicating that there might be roadwork, an obstruction, or an accident ahead. As such, the driver of the ego car should reduce speed and proceed with caution, possibly preparing to alter the route if necessary.",
