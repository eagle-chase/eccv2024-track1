This animal poses a potential hazard as its presence can lead to sudden swerving or stopping of vehicles due to its unpredictable behavior. Additionally, there are electronic overhead gantry signs displayed above the road, though their specific content is unclear because of the image quality. These signs could include essential information such as speed limits, warnings, or directional information needed for safe driving and compliance with traffic laws. Furthermore, concrete barriers are present on both sides of the lane, creating a narrow path for vehicles. These barriers limit the maneuverability of the ego car, adding to the difficulty of avoiding sudden obstacles like the dog."
