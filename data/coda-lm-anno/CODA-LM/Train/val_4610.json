This indicates that the truck may slow down or stop suddenly to make the turn, which is critical for the ego car's decision-making. Additionally, a silver car and a white vehicle are spotted on the left side, moving in the same direction as the ego car. The presence of these vehicles may affect the ego car's lane choice and overtaking maneuvers.\n\nOn the right side, closer to the curb, two motorcyclists are moving in the same direction as the ego car. Their proximity necessitates cautious driving from the ego car, particularly when turning or merging to the right, to maintain a safe distance.\n\nDirectional signs are present on a pole to the left, providing information on available lanes and directions. These signs are important for the ego car's navigation and lane selection. Traffic lights are also in view, but the signal color is not clear from the image. The ego car must continuously monitor the traffic lights to know when to stop or proceed.\n\nGreen barriers are noted along a road construction area to the left, indicating a construction zone that may result in reduced lane width or temporary traffic patterns. This requires the ego car to drive cautiously.\n\nThe conditions are clear with good ambient light and no visible obstructions such as debris or animals, which contributes to safer and more confident driving decisions. Traffic cones are not present in the image, and thus, no action is required regarding them."
