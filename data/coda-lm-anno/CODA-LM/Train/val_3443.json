The truck is easily noticeable due to its bright tail lights and reflective markings, which are particularly visible under low-light conditions. The existence of this truck in the ego car's lane is significant as it necessitates the maintenance of a safe following distance by the ego car. Additionally, the ego car may need to contemplate changing lanes if there's a requirement to overtake, provided that it's feasible and can be done safely. Other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects have no items listed, indicating their absence from this specific traffic image."

The size and type of such vehicles often mean they are slower moving and may make sudden or wide turns. Therefore, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for unpredictable maneuvers or stops, especially on roadways near construction sites.",
