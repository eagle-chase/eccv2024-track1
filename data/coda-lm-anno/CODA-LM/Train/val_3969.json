While this vehicle does not directly affect the ego vehicle's path, it is important to keep an eye on it in case it makes an unexpected lane change.\n\nThere are traffic cones and drums placed on the right side of the road, forming a taper that leads to a lane shift or closure. The presence of these cones mandates the ego vehicle to shift its position to safely navigate away from the work zone.\n\nAdditionally, there are temporary movable barriers located on the right side, which demarcate the work zone from active traffic lanes. The ego vehicle is required to exercise increased caution and may need to reduce speed due to the proximity of personnel or machinery to the driving lane.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
