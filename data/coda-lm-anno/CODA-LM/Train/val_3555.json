        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are primarily two categories of road users observed: vulnerable road users and other objects. The vulnerable road users identified are pedestrians who are near roadside objects, positioned to the right of the ego car's lane. The presence of pedestrians close to the roadway is critical as they can be unpredictable, and there's a potential risk that one or more might step into the traffic lane, affecting the driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating more cautious driving and readiness to stop.\n\nFurthermore, amongst other objects, there are large spools of cable and miscellaneous objects also located on the right side of the road near the pedestrians. These items pose additional risks as they could either obscure a pedestrian from view or create situations where pedestrians might suddenly enter the roadway to get around these obstructions. This scenario again alerts the ego car to exercise increased vigilance and preparedness for unexpected pedestrian movements into the lane, thereby influencing cautious driving behavior."

These large coils are typically used in industrial or construction settings, often for electrical, telecommunication, or heavy infrastructure projects. For the ego car, encountering such industrial equipment near the roadway increases the need for heightened awareness and caution. The presence of such material suggests heavy vehicle traffic or nearby industrial activity, which could involve sudden movements or obstructions not usual in regular traffic conditions.",
