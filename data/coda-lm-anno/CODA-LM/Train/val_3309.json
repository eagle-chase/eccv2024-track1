        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there is a line of stationary construction vehicles parked on the right side of the road, which includes excavators and bulldozers. The presence of these vehicles reduces the available lane width for driving and can cause potential obstructions. Alongside these vehicles, there is a cyclist riding on the right side of the road, closely passing the stationary construction vehicles. The cyclist represents a possible hazard as they could swerve to avoid the construction equipment, potentially entering the path of the ego car, which would need to be ready to react accordingly. Moreover, there is a wall running parallel to the line of construction vehicles, which acts as a physical barrier further limiting road space. This wall necessitates careful maneuvering by the ego car, particularly when navigating the reduced road width caused by the parked construction vehicles. The image contains no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects that need to be accounted for in this summary."
