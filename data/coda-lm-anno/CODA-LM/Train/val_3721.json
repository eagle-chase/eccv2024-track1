The first vehicle is a heavy-duty truck positioned directly ahead of the ego car, distinguished by its hazard markings and reflective stripes. This is an important consideration as it suggests that the truck may be moving slowly or preparing for a turn, which would require the ego vehicle to maintain a safe distance to avoid any potential hazards.\n\nAdditionally, there's an SUV positioned on the right side and slightly ahead of the ego vehicle, but in the adjoining lane. The SUV's proximity could affect the ego car's ability to safely change lanes or make positional adjustments necessary under changing driving conditions.\n\nOn the infrastructure side, there are road barriers on the left side of the frame, delineating a clear separation from the oncoming traffic lanes. The barriers play a critical role in directing the flow of traffic and ensuring the ego vehicle stays within the correct lane, assisting in the overall maintenance of road safety.\n\nNotably absent from this scene are vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, and other miscellaneous objects."

It is characterized by its substantial size, robust build, and the presence of safety warning markings such as reflective stripes.

Stay alert for any potential traffic signs or signals that may come into view."
