These vehicles appear to be stationary due to traffic conditions or while waiting at a signal, and thus their movements should be tracked by the autonomous driving system to assess any potential risk of them suddenly moving.\n\nThere are vulnerable road users present, specifically a woman and two children who are on the far right side of the road, nearing a pedestrian crossing. Their intent to cross the road should be anticipated as it is a common action near such crossings, and the ego vehicle needs to prepare to stop or slow down to ensure their safety.\n\nOn the roadside, there are traffic signs providing directions to Kanpur and Delhi and warning of a nearby school zone, indicative of an area with heightened pedestrian activity, likely involving children. These signs help the autonomous driving system understand the traffic dynamics and the need for enhanced caution whilst driving through the area.\n\nRegarding barriers, there are yellow and black striped ones located to the left side of the road surrounding a small landscaped area. These barriers are installed to control traffic movement and prevent vehicles from entering the landscaped area.\n\nLastly, there is heavy equipment visible, such as an excavator parked at a distance on the left side of the road, signaling the possibility of either ongoing or forthcoming roadworks. This would require the autonomous vehicle system to proceed with caution due to potential stops or diversions.\n\nThere are no traffic lights or traffic cones reported in the scene provided."
