This pedestrian should not affect the driving behavior of the ego car as they are not on the roadway. Additionally, there is a cyclist in motion on the right side of the ego car, which could influence the car's ability to maneuver or change lanes to the right because of their proximity.

Lastly, a concrete barrier with reflective stripes is seen on the right side of the road, suggesting possible construction or a road closure ahead. The ego car should be prepared to slow down or navigate cautiously in response to this barrier."
