These vehicles indicate ongoing construction work and may cause unexpected movements or operations that could impact the traffic flow. Additionally, two workers are visible on the pedestrian path, also to the right of the road; they are close enough to the roadway that there is a possibility they might enter the road, which requires the ego car to remain vigilant.\n\nComplementing these factors, there are yellow traffic cones aligned along the right lane that stretch toward the parked construction vehicles. These cones are signalling a lane restriction that appears to be related to the construction activity, prompting traffic to stay at a safe distance from the work zone.\n\nFurthermore, yellow barriers have been placed adjacent to the pedestrian pathway on the right, extending along the visible length of the image. These barriers serve to demarcate the construction zone from the active lanes of the road to ensure the safety of both the workers and motorists by preventing unintended encroachments into the construction area.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects reported in this scene."
