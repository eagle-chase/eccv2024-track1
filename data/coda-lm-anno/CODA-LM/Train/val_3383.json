The truck's operational rear lights signal that it is decelerating or preparing to halt. This requires the autonomous vehicle to adjust its speed and maintain an appropriate following distance to comply with traffic regulations and ensure safety.\n\nAdditionally, the traffic lights in the view are displaying a green signal for the lane the autonomous vehicle is in, indicating it is clear to proceed, provided that the way is safe and the situation with the truck ahead is taken into account.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a faded blue and white road barrier is located on the central reservation, highlighting the boundary between opposite lanes of traffic. Recognizing this barrier is vital for the autonomous vehicle as it limits the possibility of lateral maneuvers."

The presence of this vehicle in front of the ego car suggests that the ego car should maintain a safe following distance to avoid any debris or unexpected stops that the construction vehicle might make. Additionally, due to the size of the construction vehicle, the ego car's driver needs to be cautious about the vehicles blind spots and potential wide turns or maneuvers.",

The ego car's driver should be aware of the moped's presence and maintain a safe distance, besides being extra vigilant about the moped potentially making sudden lane changes or turns. The driver should also be prepared for different stopping capacities of the moped in comparison to larger vehicles.",
