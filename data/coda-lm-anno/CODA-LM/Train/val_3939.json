These vehicles are stationary, and there's no identifiable activity happening around them. The key issue with these parked vehicles is that they limit the available space on the road that can be used for navigation. Moreover, they could potentially conceal pedestrians or other potential hazards from the view of the ego vehicle, which could unexpectedly enter the vehicle's path, posing a risk for accidents.\n\nAdditionally, there is a concern regarding glare, possibly originating from either oncoming vehicles or streetlights. This glare can be particularly challenging as it might temporarily blind or distract the driver or affect the ego vehicle's sensing systems. The primary risk associated with this glare is a significant reduction in the ability to perceive and react timely to other road users or alterations in the road conditions, potentially increasing the likelihood of an incident."
