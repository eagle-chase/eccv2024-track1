This vehicle is important for the autonomous system because its speed and presence will influence the ego car's decision-making regarding safe speed maintenance and distance keeping. Additionally, there are multiple orange traffic cones arranged on the left side, which partially block the left lane. These cones serve as an indication that the left lane may be inaccessible, likely due to road work or present hazards, and therefore the autonomous vehicle should remain in the right lane. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects present in the scene that could affect driving behavior."

The presence of multiple cones forming a line parallel to the cars trajectory suggests that the lane might be narrowing or closed off, indicating that the driver should remain alert and possibly change lanes if the current lane is obstructed.",
