Additionally, there are various cars in front and to the left of the ego car, all appearing to be in motion. The presence of multiple vehicles in proximity requires cautious speed management and readiness to stop or maneuver as needed to maintain a safe following distance.\n\nOn the right side of the road, cyclists are visible, with one of them right next to the truck. These cyclists near the truck pose additional risks as they could be obscured from view or need to suddenly change their path due to the truck's encroachment. This necessitates increased awareness and preparedness to stop or yield by the ego car.\n\nFurthermore, there are sacks piled on the side of the road near ongoing construction. These sacks are potentially hazardous if they encroach onto the road and need to be monitored as they could be an obstruction if they fall or are blown onto the roadway.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
