A large truck with bright, reflective safety markings is positioned on the left side of the ego vehicle. The truck is navigating through the lane, partially occupying the ego vehicle's lane. This truck's proximity and partial lane occupation dictate the ego vehicle's available maneuvering space and require heightened attention.\n\n2.

It is recognized by its large size, industrial design, and visible safety markings including horizontally striped patterns in yellow and black. As a construction vehicle, it typically moves slower and may stop or execute maneuvers atypical to regular traffic flow, thus requiring surrounding vehicles to maintain increased vigilance and possibly slow down or change lanes to accommodate its operation on the road.",

It features a bright, reflective surface patterned with red and white stripes to ensure high visibility. In driving scenarios, such a barrier indicates that part of the road or adjacent areas are likely to be obstructed or subject to special conditions. Drivers should prepare to slow down, heed any additional signage or personnel instructions, and possibly detour or navigate carefully around the barrier.",
