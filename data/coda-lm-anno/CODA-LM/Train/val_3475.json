        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scenario, there are multiple elements to take into consideration. Firstly, there is a car directly ahead in the left lane with its brake lights on, suggesting it might be coming to a stop or slowing down. Accordingly, the ego car must be prepared to decelerate or stop to keep a safe distance.\n\nAnother car is observed in the right lane, travelling in the same direction without any visible brake lights, indicating it is moving steadily. This should be factored into the ego carâ€™s potential lane changing maneuvers or speed adjustments, especially if the left lane car comes to a stop.\n\nThe driving path is further complicated by traffic cones set up to the right of the ego car, suggesting a narrow passage likely due to road work or an obstruction. The ego car will need to remain vigilant and might have to merge left if the right lane is becoming impassable.\n\nLastly, a three-wheeled cart is positioned slightly to the right of the ego car, partially in the right lane. This can present a hazard, especially if it is stationary or moving slowly, and could prevent the ego car from changing lanes to the right if necessary due to the stopping vehicle ahead in the left lane.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or barriers were reported in this scene, indicating that such elements are either absent or not relevant in this situation."
