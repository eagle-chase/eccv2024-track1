        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a large truck on the same lane as the ego car, partially loaded with visible debris on top. The presence of this truck is significant as it is directly ahead and appears to be losing some of its load, which could create dangerous obstacles on the road. Additionally, several cars can be seen on the lanes adjacent to the ego car's right side. These vehicles are important to monitor as they may affect when and how the ego car can safely change lanes.\n\nAs for traffic signals, there is a traffic light ahead displaying a red light for traffic going straight and a green left arrow, signaling that vehicles in the direction of the ego car must halt, while vehicles making a left turn are allowed to proceed.\n\nAmong other hazards, there is debris falling from the truck in front of the ego car. This falling debris is a direct threat not only to the ego car but also to other motorists, as it could lead to tire damage or cause accidents."

It is essential to increase caution when driving behind or near such large industrial vehicles because they often make sudden stops or movements, and the risk of debris falling off can present hazards. The driver of the ego vehicle should maintain a safe following distance to ensure there's enough time to react to any unforeseen actions the construction vehicle might take.",

Do not attempt changing lanes unless absolutely necessary, due to the truck's position and road conditions."
