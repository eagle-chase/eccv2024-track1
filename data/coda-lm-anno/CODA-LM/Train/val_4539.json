These vehicles are stationary, positioned beside the curbside, implying they are parked. It is important for the ego car to keep a safe distance from them to avoid potential hazards such as unexpected door openings or pedestrians stepping out from behind these parked vehicles. Additionally, thereâ€™s a traffic light displaying a red light ahead on the road. This signals to the ego car that it must come to a stop and wait for the light to turn green before continuing. The presence of this red light ensures the regulation of traffic flow and enhances safety at the approaching intersection. Other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects do not feature any items in this particular image and thus do not influence the driving behavior in the current scenario."
