Alongside these heavy vehicles, several cars and trucks are also parked, which notably reduces the available width of the road for moving traffic. The presence of these parked vehicles substantially decreases road space and visibility for oncoming traffic, which elevates the risk of unexpected obstacles emerging in the path of the ego car, subsequently necessitating cautious navigation.\n\nAdditionally, there is an array of construction-related equipment and materials located adjacent to the parked machinery and vehicles. These items could introduce further hazards if they are not adequately secured or if they begin to spill over onto the road, thereby posing an additional risk of encountering unexpected obstacles during transit."

This vehicle is equipped with the capacity to perform heavy-duty tasks such as lifting, digging, or pushing construction material. Its presence on or near the roadway suggests ongoing construction work. For the ego car, this implies there could be potential obstructions or diversions ahead. The driver needs to remain alert for sudden changes in traffic flow or temporary signage directing traffic around the construction zone. Additionally, the speed limit might be reduced, requiring the driver to slow down for safety around the work area and personnel.",
