This vehicle's active crossing affects the ego car's driving decisions as it is within the potential path the ego car may take. Additionally, several pedestrians, including an individual walking a dog, are crossing the road directly in front of the ego car. Given that the pedestrians hold the right of way, itâ€™s essential for the ego car to either come to a full stop or reduce speed considerably to ensure their safety. Meanwhile, the traffic light situated at the top right indicates green for the lanes running parallel to the ego vehicle's direction and red for those that intersect it. While the green signal typically allows for traffic to proceed, the presence of the pedestrians in the crosswalk takes precedence over the green light, necessitating that the ego car remains stationary until the crosswalk is empty and safe to proceed."
