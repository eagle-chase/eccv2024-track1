There are two vehicles and one traffic sign.\n\nFirst, there is a yellow excavator on a transport truck located in the left lane beside the ego car, moving in the same direction. The presence and size of this truck carrying an excavator might impact the ego car's lane due to its potential for unexpected movements.\n\nSecond, a white SUV is directly ahead of the ego car in the same lane, also moving in the same direction. The ego car must keep a safe following distance from this SUV to accommodate any changes in speed or sudden stops.\n\nLastly, there is a blue rectangular sign with white text on the left side of the road. Although the text is not legible and its specific instructions are unknown, it may still hold important information for drivers that could influence the ego car's driving decisions."
