Since it is not in the same lane as the ego car and it is a safe distance away, it does not directly influence the ego car's immediate driving decisions.\n\nAnother vehicle is traveling ahead of the ego car in the same lane and is moving in the same direction, with a safe distance between them. The ego car should maintain this safe following distance and be ready to adapt its speed if the leading vehicle changes its speed or lane.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there is a no entry sign situated on the right side of the road, attached to a barrier, which signifies that there is a closed lane or road ahead. This requires the ego car to potentially adjust its planned route, particularly if it intended to make a right turn soon.\n\nAs for traffic cones, they have been placed in the right lane, signaling a closure of that lane, possibly due to roadworks. The ego car should continue in its current lane without trying to merge into the closed right lane.\n\nConcerning barriers, there are temporary barriers set up with lights and reflective stripes located in the right lane, indicating that the lane is closed. The ego car needs to stay in its current lane to bypass the closed right lane and should be on the lookout for other vehicles that might be merging from that lane.\n\nIn this traffic image, there are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects that would affect the ego car's driving behavior."
