        "description and explanation": "The image presents a traffic scene with several notable elements. There are multiple vehicles ahead, aligned in traffic and moving forward. These cars are directly influencing the movement and speed adjustments of the ego car, necessitating that it follows their pace and observes their brake lights to maintain safety and flow. Furthermore, the scene includes a traffic light in the distance, which is currently green. This signal allows traffic, including the ego car, to proceed but also implies the need for vigilance as the light's status may change to yellow or red, requiring timely slowing down or stopping. The absence of vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects in this specific scene simplifies the driving environment but necessitates continued attention to the vehicles and traffic light mentioned."

This debris poses a potential hazard to vehicles, particularly at high speeds, as it might cause a vehicle to lose control or suffer tire damage. The ego car should adjust its driving behavior by slowing down and maneuvering safely around the debris to avoid any risk of accident or vehicle damage. This adjustment will likely involve changing lanes if it is safe to do so, or significantly reducing speed when passing near the debris.",
