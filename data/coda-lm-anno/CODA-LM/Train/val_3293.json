The braking or lane-changing actions of this car could influence the ego car's driving decisions.\n\n- **Traffic Signs**: \n  - There is a pedestrian crossing sign on the right side of the road. This sign indicates an area where pedestrians might be crossing, so the ego car should be prepared to stop or slow down for pedestrians.\n\n- **Traffic Lights**: \n  - A traffic light is visible ahead over the pedestrian crossing and is currently red.

            "description and explanation": "The object is a construction vehicle, specifically a concrete mixer truck. This vehicle is equipped with a rotating drum used to mix cement, sand, water, and gravel to form concrete. The presence of this large vehicle on the road generally indicates active construction in nearby areas. For the ego car, this means that additional caution is necessary while driving. The truck's size, often slower speeds, and frequent stops to deliver concrete at construction sites can affect traffic flow and driving conditions. Drivers should maintain a safe following distance and be alert for sudden stops or debris falling from the vehicle.",

Keep an eye on the white van and other vehicles in adjacent lanes for unexpected lane changes or braking, especially since traffic appears to be heavy and movement could be erratic. Prepare to stop at the pedestrian crossing due to the traffic light being red and the possibility of pedestrians. No lane change is recommended at this moment due to the heavy traffic and limited space."
