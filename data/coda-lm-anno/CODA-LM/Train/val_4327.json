However, there is a traffic sign visible; it is a speed limit sign showing '20' on the right side of the road, mounted at a higher elevation with an additional sign indicating a downward slope. This sign is important as it informs the ego car to reduce its speed to 20 km/h to comply with traffic regulations and to maintain control on the slope.\n\nAdditionally, there are traffic cones and barriers placed in the right lane, signaling road work or an obstruction. The presence of these objects requires the ego car to either slow down or change lanes to safely navigate around the blocked area and adhere to road regulations.\n\nConcrete barriers are also present, lining the right side of the road and extending into the distance, eventually blending with metal guardrails. These barriers serve to delineate the road boundaries and indicate areas that are impassable. As a result, the ego car must maintain careful lane keeping due to the reduced width of the drivable road space.\n\nThere are no traffic lights or other objects reported in the image."
