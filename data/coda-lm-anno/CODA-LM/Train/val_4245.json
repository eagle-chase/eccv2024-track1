It seems that the white car is moving into or crossing the junction. This vehicle's position and trajectory are critical as it may intersect with the ego car's path. Consequently, caution is essential to either avoid a potential collision or to yield appropriately according to right-of-way rules.\n\nAdditionally, there is a blue traffic sign with the number '6' on the right side of the image. It likely denotes a bus stop or serves as a route marker. Although it does not require immediate action from the ego car, it is valuable information that aids in navigation. Other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects are not present in this scene."
