The van is noticeable, having texts and logos on its back window. The proximity of this vehicle necessitates the ego car to adjust its speed and maintain a safe following distance for safety and compliance with traffic conditions.\n\n2. **Traffic Cones**:\n   - On the right side of the road, several traffic cones along with visible construction barriers are positioned. The presence of these cones and barriers likely indicates an area of road work or an obstruction, mandating cautious driving, possible lane changes, or reduction in speed to navigate safely around the potential hazard.\n\n3. **Barriers**:\n   - There are green mesh barriers alongside road construction signs also on the right side of the road. Such barriers typically signal ongoing construction or road maintenance activities, prompting vehicles to alter their path to the left and proceed with enhanced caution.\n\n4. **Other Objects**:\n   - Close to the barriers, large concrete pipes are located near the road on the right side. The placement of construction materials like these pipes near the driving lane indicates the necessity for heightened alertness due to probable further obstructions or unanticipated movements emanating from the construction site.\n\nThe combinations of these elements create a complex driving environment where the ego car must continuously adapt to varying road conditions, ensuring safety and fluid traffic flow amidst potential disruptions from road work and nearby vehicles."
