This object appears to be used for storing and transporting large quantities of cable or wire. Given its size and placement by the roadside, it is important for driving behavior as the ego car should maintain a safe distance to avoid any potential obstacles that might arise if these large objects were to unexpectedly move or roll into the roadway.",

Constructed from sturdy materials to sustain the weight and bulk of wound cables, these spools are often seen in industrial or construction areas. For drivers, they are usually non-concerning and expected to be immobile, situated on the roadside or within a work site. However, their presence signals that construction or utility work may be occurring nearby which could lead to potential diversions or temporary traffic obstructions.",
