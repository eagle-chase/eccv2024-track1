This red and white circular sign prohibits vehicles from entering a certain road or area, directly influencing the driving path of the ego car. Additionally, there is a barrier or gate on the right side, blocking entrance to a facility and featuring an illuminated panel that displays information. This barrier regulates access to the area, which may be significant if the ego car needs to enter this facility. Furthermore, beyond the 'No Entry' sign, there is an illuminated outdoor advertising board. While this board does not directly affect driving decisions, its bright illumination could potentially distract drivers, especially at night."
