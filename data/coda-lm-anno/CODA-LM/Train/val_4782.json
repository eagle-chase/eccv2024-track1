This mix includes both moving and stationary vehicles. The driving behavior of the ego car is influenced by these vehicles as they determine the traffic flow and may cause changes in traffic speed.

The visibility of this car influences the driving behavior of the ego car by requiring the driver to maintain a safe following distance and be aware of the cars speed and trajectory. The ego car may need to adjust speed or change lanes to ensure safe driving conditions, particularly if the marked car begins to slow down or indicates a lane change.",
