        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several road users and vehicles that are noteworthy. Firstly, there is a blue truck on the left side of the photo, which is stationary with its door open. Additionally, a white truck is present on the right side, also appearing to be stationary. The presence of these trucks is significant as they are large and can block the view, making it difficult to see other road users that may be moving around them.\n\nIn the center of the image, an orange forklift is in operation, carrying visible cargo with the driver present, indicating that it is actively being used. The forklift represents a dynamic obstacle due to its movement and operation, which are unpredictable and can affect the surrounding environment. This requires the ego car to pay close attention to the forklift's actions.\n\nFurthermore, there is a pedestrian wearing a green shirt walking towards the right side of the image, in close proximity to the moving forklift and the stationary vehicles. The pedestrian's location near the large vehicles and active equipment within the road area is a critical factor for the ego car's decision-making to ensure safety.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image. Therefore, the ego car's primary considerations in this scenario are the stationary trucks, the active forklift, and the pedestrian moving close to these vehicles."

It is typically used on construction sites to lift and move heavy materials over short distances. The presence of a forklift in this driving scenario suggests active construction work nearby. As a result, the ego car should adjust its driving behavior by reducing speed and staying vigilant for sudden stops or changes in the flow of traffic, as well as the potential appearance of construction workers and other machinery.",
