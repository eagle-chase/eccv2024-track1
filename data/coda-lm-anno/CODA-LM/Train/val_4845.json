Firstly, there is a large cement truck on the right side, close to the ego vehicle, which is partially obstructing the right lane. The size and position of this truck limit the available space for the ego vehicle to maneuver and necessitate careful navigation to maintain a safe distance from the truck.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple cars in various lanes ahead, with a white car positioned directly in front of the ego vehicle. The presence of these vehicles adds complexity to the driving environment, requiring the ego vehicle to remain alert to their movements and be prepared for potential sudden changes in speed or direction.\n\nThe traffic lights in the scene are showing green for both going straight and turning left, indicating that the ego vehicle is allowed to proceed. However, it is important for the ego vehicle to stay ready to stop in case the traffic lights change.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."

Such vehicles are typically heavy and slow-moving. The presence of this vehicle influences the ego car's driving behavior by necessitating increased caution and possibly reduced speed when passing or traveling near it, to account for unexpected stops or turns by the construction vehicle.",

Continue monitoring the surrounding traffic, especially the vehicles directly ahead, for any abrupt changes in speed or behavior. As the traffic light is green, proceed with caution while being prepared to stop if the lights change to yellow or red. Always check mirrors and blind spots before any lane changes to ensure the path is clear of other vehicles."
