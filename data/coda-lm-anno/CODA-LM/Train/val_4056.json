The presence of these vehicles dictates the ego car's traveling speed, as it needs to keep a safe following distance and pace with the flow of traffic.\n\nAdditionally, there is a pedestrian donning a high-visibility yellow jacket, who is near the street standing alongside toppled green waste containers. This pedestrian could represent a risk as their actions or the unexpected movement of the debris could impede the ego carâ€™s path.\n\nIn terms of traffic infrastructure, two traffic lights are identified in the scene, both displaying a green light over the intersection that signify that the ego car has the right to proceed. However, due to the close proximity of pedestrians and potential roadway obstructions, it would be wise to exercise caution while driving.\n\nFurther complicating navigation, there are fallen green waste containers and other debris that have spilled onto the roadway, situated right before the ego car. These elements introduce additional hazards that may necessitate the driver to perform evasive maneuvers to maintain road safety.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects reported in this scenario that impact the driving conditions for the ego car."
