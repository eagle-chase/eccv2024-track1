        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there is a large red truck positioned directly ahead of our vehicle, the ego car. This truck has its brake lights on, which may indicate that it is either moving slowly or has come to a stop. Due to this, the ego vehicle should maintain a secure distance from the truck to ensure there's adequate space for stopping or decelerating if necessary.\n\nAdditionally, there are noteworthy reflections and a lens flare caused by the bright lights of the truck. These can potentially interfere with the visibility for both the autonomous driving sensors of the ego car and the human driverâ€™s sight. Consequently, extra caution is advised to deal with the potential visibility issues that arise from the glare."

The illumination of the trucks brake lights suggests that the truck is either slowing down or stopped, making it crucial for the ego vehicle to monitor this truck's movements closely to respond appropriately, either by slowing down, stopping, or preparing for any sudden turns the truck might make.",
