It has multiple visible rear lights, likely including taillights and brake lights, which are illuminated. The size and nature of the truck suggest it could be slower-moving and may require a longer distance to stop due to its mass, affecting the driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating increased following distance and heightened awareness for sudden stops or turns made by the truck.",
