A heavy truck is directly in front of the ego car in the right-hand lane, displaying a green arrow indicating a functional arrow board. This truck occupies a significant portion of the lane and needs to be monitored for any sudden speed changes or maneuvers. Additionally, a container truck is visible to the left of the ego car in the adjacent lane. This truck's size can impact visibility and influence lane choices for the ego car.\n\nAlso visible in the image is a green traffic light ahead on the road. The green light indicates that traffic is currently flowing, and the intersection ahead can be crossed or entered."

The presence of this vehicle in the driving scenario typically indicates that there might be construction activity nearby. Its size and the nature of the equipment it carries require other drivers to be cautious and possibly prepare for unexpected stops or reduced lanes ahead, influencing driving behavior to be more alert and conservative in speed to ensure safety.",
