Positioned on the roadway, it plays a critical role in influencing the driving behavior by indicating that drivers should maneuver around it, thereby avoiding this marked zone. This could be indicative of a hazardous area, road work ahead, or a temporary obstruction requiring drivers to slow down and pay additional attention to their surroundings.",
