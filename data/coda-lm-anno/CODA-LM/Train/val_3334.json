Firstly, there is a white car merging from the right side, positioned diagonally to the ego car. This merging white car is a potential hazard as it may cut into the lane of the ego car. Additionally, there is a truck on the right side on a side road. The presence of this truck suggests that it may merge into the same road as the ego car, prompting the ego car to be ready to slow down or change lanes if necessary.\n\nFurthermore, multiple cars are parked on the left side of the road. While these parked cars do not pose an immediate threat, they may obstruct the vision of any pedestrian attempting to cross the road or other vehicles that might want to re-enter the traffic flow. There is also a truck ahead carrying a large cargo. This truck is significant because it can reduce visibility and reaction time for the ego car and may slow down abruptly to make turns.\n\nLastly, there is an orange traffic cone on the right side of the main road. This cone could signify an upcoming construction area or a lane closure, so the ego car should remain cautious and prepared for potential changes in the traffic pattern. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
