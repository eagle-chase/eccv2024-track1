        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are no vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects present. However, there is a noteworthy presence of traffic cones. These cones are a series of orange traffic cones lined up on the right side of the road, marking off a section of the lane that is closed. The placement of the cones is a clear indication that part of the road is currently unavailable for use, which could be due to ongoing road work or an existing hazard. Consequently, this situation necessitates that the autonomous vehicle, referred to as the ego car, must adapt its driving path to steer clear of the closed lane section and safely continue its journey."

            "description and explanation": "The object is a traffic cone, which is typically used to indicate areas that are temporarily off limits for vehicle traffic. It is bright orange with a reflective stripe, making it highly visible. In this driving scenario, the presence of the traffic cone suggests that there may be some sort of roadwork, obstruction, or hazard ahead in that particular lane. The ego car should avoid this lane and prepare to navigate around the cones safely, maintaining awareness of possible changes in road conditions or detours that might affect driving behavior.",

In this driving scenario, the presence of the traffic cone suggests that there might be road work ahead or a section of the lane that is closed, requiring the driver to potentially steer clear of the cone by changing lanes or carefully navigating around it.",
