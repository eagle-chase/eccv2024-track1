The presence of this bus suggests that there might be pedestrian movement as passengers get on and off, which requires other vehicles to be cautious and prepared to stop. Additionally, a construction truck is parked on the right side of the road, with an active crane. The operation of this truck could unpredictably affect the nearby traffic flow and may cause sudden obstructions.\n\nA pedestrian is also present, walking near the center of the road towards the bus. This pedestrian may cross the road or approach the bus, indicating that drivers should proceed with caution and be ready to stop if necessary.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there is a blue circular sign indicating a mandatory right turn ahead, which is mounted on a pole to the right side of the road. This sign is directing traffic to turn right, thereby influencing the route that the ego car must take.\n\nAlthough there are no traffic lights in the image, there are orange traffic cones placed around the construction area on the right side of the road. These cones create a partition, marking a no-entry zone for vehicles around the construction site, which reduces the usable road width and guides the traffic flow.\n\nIn addition to the cones, there is a strip of white and red temporary barriers alongside the cones near the construction site. These barriers serve as additional visual cues for drivers to avoid the construction zone and help channel traffic safely.\n\nLastly, there are multiple dustbins lined up alongside the construction site by the side of the road. While these dustbins might not directly influence driving behavior, they are part of the environmental context that drivers need to be aware of to ensure complete situational understanding."
