These scooters are stationary and off the road, presenting no immediate hazard, but the situation should be monitored for any sudden movements or individuals possibly departing on the scooters.\n\nThere are a couple of traffic signs: a no-parking sign to the left of the ego vehicle indicating that parking is prohibited in that area, thus the ego car should avoid stopping or parking there. Additionally, directional traffic signs on a pole to the right of the ego vehicle signal a junction ahead where the road turns left, informing the ego vehicle of upcoming road geometry and potential merging or crossing traffic.\n\nA median barrier runs along the left side of the roadway opposite the ego vehicle. This barrier separates traffic directions and indicates that the ego car must follow the road to the right, in a manner that it cannot make a left turn there.\n\nLastly, there is a toppled traffic cone and a small bucket on the ground near the corner where the scooters are parked. These objects could become potential hazards if they are moved onto the roadway, so caution should be exercised when passing near them."
