Directly ahead, there is a large bus with bright red brake lights illuminated, suggesting it is either stopping or has significantly slowed down. This necessitates that the ego car maintain a safe following distance to avoid a collision due to potential stoppage or heavy traffic ahead.\n\nAdditionally, a red traffic light is visible directly ahead on a large overhead gantry and applies to all lanes, requiring the ego car to come to a complete stop to comply with traffic regulations and ensure safety.\n\nOn the left side, a series of red and white reflective traffic cones demarcate the boundary of the driving lane and a closed lane, indicating a lane closure or roadwork ahead. The ego car must stay within the open lane and remain alert for potential redirects or workers near the roadway.\n\nFurthermore, a solid road median barrier is visible on the left side, which separates opposing traffic flows. This barrier ensures that the ego car remains within its designated lane and does not veer into oncoming traffic.\n\nOverall, these identified road users and objects require attentive and cautious driving behavior for safe navigation through the current traffic conditions."
