Care must be taken when passing by this vehicle as it could affect the drivable space available for the ego car.\n\nOn the sidewalk to the right, thereâ€™s a pedestrian who is facing away from the road, seemingly preoccupied with something on the ground or poised to bend over. While the pedestrian does not currently present an immediate risk, it would be wise to keep an eye on them for any unexpected movements towards the road.\n\nAdditionally, a small, light-colored animal, which could be either a dog or a cat, appears to be in the middle of the road moving away from the ego car's trajectory. Given the unpredictable nature of animals, the ego car should reduce speed and be ready to stop to prevent a potential collision.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers recorded in the scene. Any of these categories not mentioned are absent from the image and therefore do not require consideration."
