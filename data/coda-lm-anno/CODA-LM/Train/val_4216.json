        "description and explanation": "The scene contains various road users that impact driving behavior, particularly focusing on vehicles. There are large tow trucks situated in the right lane, which are easily noticeable due to their bright orange and yellow colors and equipped with visible safety lights. The location and function of these trucks suggest that they are prone to execute sudden maneuvers, such as stopping or turning abruptly. Their considerable size also has the potential to block the driver's view, which is an essential factor to consider for safe navigation. \n\nAdditionally, there is a bus ahead in the left lane, moving in the same direction as the ego car. The bus is distinguishable by an advertisement displayed on it. Given that buses are known to make frequent stops to pick up and drop off passengers, the presence of this bus near the ego car calls for heightened awareness regarding the possibility of it making an unexpected stop.\n\nThe analysis does not indicate the presence of vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or any other objects in the scene, suggesting a scene primarily dominated by vehicles with significant implications on the driving behavior of the ego car."
