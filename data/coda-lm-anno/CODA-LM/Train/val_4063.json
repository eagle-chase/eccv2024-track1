        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several notable elements that are relevant to the autonomous driving system. Firstly, there is a large yellow flatbed tow truck parked on the right side of the road, carrying construction equipment. The presence of this truck is significant because its size and load could potentially affect traffic flow and safety conditions if it starts moving or if the load shifts.\n\nDirectly in front of the ego car, there is a dark grey sedan. This vehicle is in the same lane and moving in the same direction as the ego car. The behavior of this sedan is particularly important as it will directly influence the ego car's immediate driving decisions, such as speed adjustments and braking.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic light next to the construction zone, currently displaying a red signal. This red light requires the vehicles, including the ego car, to stop and wait until the light turns green to proceed.\n\nSurrounding the construction zone, there are red and white traffic cones arranged in a line. These cones are marking the construction area, which may reduce the width of the drivable road or necessitate detours. Consequently, the ego car may need to alter its driving path or adjust its speed in response to these changes.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that would impact the driving behavior of the ego car."
