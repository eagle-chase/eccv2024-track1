        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there is a red forklift truck located on the left side of the road. It is positioned parallel to the road's direction and is partly on the pedestrian crossing. The presence and position of the forklift could suggest a possibility of sudden movement, either continuing across the road or turning onto it, potentially interfering with the path of the ego car.\n\nAdditionally, two traffic lights are visible in the scene, both displaying a red light for the direction in which the ego car is facing. This indicates that the ego car is required to stop at the intersection and wait until the lights turn green before proceeding.\n\nFurthermore, temporary green barriers are noticeable on both sides of the road, appearing to enclose an area of construction or maintenance work. These barriers imply that there may be ongoing work which could be narrowing the lanes or causing obstructions that are not directly visible to the ego car.\n\nIn conclusion, the scene includes a red forklift truck that may suddenly move, traffic lights indicating a stop requirement for the ego car, and barriers suggesting ongoing roadside work. The ego car's driving behavior must be adjusted to accommodate these conditions for safe navigation through the area."

            "description and explanation": "This is a construction vehicle, specifically a forklift, located on the right side of the road. Forklifts are typically used to move and lift heavy materials over short distances. In a traffic scenario, the presence of a construction vehicle such as a forklift near the roadside may indicate ongoing construction or maintenance work. The future driving behavior of the ego car should involve increased alertness and possibly a reduction in speed to accommodate potential hazards from the construction site and to ensure the safety of the construction workers. Additionally, the driver should be ready to obey any temporary traffic signs or directions given by traffic controllers or construction signage.",
