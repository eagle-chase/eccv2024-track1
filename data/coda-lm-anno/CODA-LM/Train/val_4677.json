This vehicle is in a separate lane and is not affecting the ego vehicle's immediate driving decisions. Additionally, a cyclist is present on the right side of the ego vehicle, riding in the same direction. The proximity of the cyclist to the ego vehicle's lane may influence the ego vehicle's decision to maintain lane position cautiously or change lanes. \n\nFurthermore, multiple traffic cones are placed in a line segregating the construction site on the right side from the lane of the ego vehicle. The traffic cones indicate that part of the road ahead is obstructed due to a construction site, which may require the ego vehicle to change lanes or slow down. \n\nRed and white colored barriers are also visible on the right side, suggesting a construction or work area. These barriers indicate that there might be workers or machinery ahead, and the ego vehicle should proceed with caution and possibly reduce speed. \n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects affecting the driving conditions in the image."
